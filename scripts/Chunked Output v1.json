The\nrelief was established as a measure to help preserve agricultural\nbusinesses by reducing the burden of Inheritance Tax (IHT) on the\ntransfer of agricultural land, farms, and certain associated assets. The\nintroduction of AR was part of a broader set of reforms to the taxation\nof estates upon death, which included changes to the existing Estate\nDuty framework and the introduction of Capital Transfer Tax, which later\nevolved into the current Inheritance Tax system.\n\nThe original provisions for AR were set out in Schedule 8 of the Finance\nAct 1975. These provisions allowed for a reduction in the value of\nagricultural property for the purposes of calculating the Estate Duty\npayable upon death. The relief was designed to ensure that farms could\nbe passed onto the next generation without the tax liability forcing the\nsale of the land or parts of the farming business, thus helping to\nmaintain the viability of agricultural operations and the stewardship of\nthe countryside."

    "chunk_text": "Over the years, the legislation governing AR has been amended and\nupdated to reflect changes in agricultural practices, land use, and the\nwider economic environment. Notable amendments include the Inheritance\nTax Act 1984, which restructured the framework for IHT and incorporated\nthe relief for agricultural property, and subsequent Finance Acts which\nhave made further adjustments to the relief\\'s operation and scope.\n\nThe relief has evolved to cover a range of agricultural assets,\nincluding agricultural land and pasture, farm buildings, farmhouses, and\ncertain types of tenancies. The conditions for eligibility and the rates\nof relief have also been subject to change, with significant amendments\naffecting the treatment of tenancies and the introduction of the concept\nof \\'agricultural value\\' as distinct from the market value of the\nproperty.\n\nToday, AR remains a key feature of the UK\\'s Inheritance Tax regime,\nproviding a reduction in the value of agricultural property that is\ntransferred either during the owner\\'s lifetime or upon their death,\nsubject to satisfying certain conditions related to ownership,\noccupation, and use for agricultural purposes. The relief continues to\nplay an important role in supporting the agricultural sector and\nensuring the continuity of farming businesses across generations.\n\nThe relief operates so as to reduce the proportion of the agricultural\nvalue of the asset that is chargeable (or potentially chargeable) to\nIHT. The reduction will be either 100% or 50%, depending on the nature\nof the asset. AR is given before any available annual exemptions."

    "chunk_text": "# What relief is available?\n\nThe relief is available under certain conditions and can apply in two\nmain scenarios.\n\nScenario 1: Owner-Occupied Agricultural Property\n\nThe first scenario where AR can be claimed is when an individual is both\nthe owner and occupier of the agricultural land and buildings, and they\nare actively using these assets for the purposes of their own farming\nbusiness. This means that the individual is directly involved in the\nday-to-day activities of farming the land or managing the agricultural\noperations. In this case, the individual is considered to be a working\nfarmer, and the relief is intended to ensure that the farming operations\ncan continue without a significant Inheritance Tax burden arising on the\ntransfer of the agricultural property.\n\nScenario 2: Let Agricultural Property\n\nThe second scenario where AR can be claimed is when an individual owns\nagricultural land or buildings but does not farm the land themselves.\nInstead, they let the property to another party who carries out the\nfarming activities. This situation typically involves a landowner who\nacts as a landlord, renting out their agricultural property to a tenant\nfarmer. The landowner is not required to be involved in the actual\nfarming operations to qualify for AR. The relief is available provided\nthe land is being used for agricultural purposes by the tenant and other\nqualifying conditions are met.\n\nRates of AR: For transfers of value that occur on or after 9 March 1996,\nas well as for recalculations of tax on earlier transfers following a\ndeath after that date, AR is available at certain rates as discussed\nbelow. It is important to note that the rates of relief have changed\nover time, and different rates may apply to periods before 9 March 1996.\nTherefore, it is essential to seek specific advice for transfers that\nfall within earlier periods to ensure the correct application of AR.\n\nS.116 of IHTA 1984 states that 100% Relief available where either:\n\n(a) Immediately before the transfer, the transferor enjoyed either the\n    > right to vacant possession or the right to obtain vacant\n    > possession within the next twelve months;\n\n> Extended Timeframe: Normally, the transferor should have the right to\n> vacant possession within twelve months. However, this period can be\n> extended to twenty-four months if the transferor has already given\n> notice to end the tenancy before the transfer happens. This extension\n> also allows for tax relief in the first year for tenancies that last\n> longer than twelve months but less than twenty-four months. This\n> situation is commonly known in England and Wales as a Gladstone v\n> Bower arrangement.\n>\n> Joint Tenants: The rules apply to joint tenants or tenants in common\n> (in Scotland, joint or common owners) too. If all the owners together\n> have the right to vacant possession, then each owner is considered to\n> have that right.\n>\n> Partnerships in England:\n\n-   In England, a partnership itself can\\'t hold a tenancy. Instead, the\n    > partners hold the tenancy together as joint tenants for the legal\n    > ownership and as tenants in common for the beneficial ownership.\n\n-   When a partner who is a landlord dies, the tax relief depends on\n    > whether the tenancy ends because of their death."

This applies whether the property is\nreceived through a will, intestacy, or a deed of variation. If the new\nowner occupies the property, their occupation is also backdated to the\ndate of death. This can allow the time during the estate\\'s\nadministration to count towards both the ownership and occupation\nperiods for AR.\n\nSpousal Successions (s.120(1)(b) IHTA 1984)**:** In cases where the\nrecipient is the deceased\\'s spouse or civil partner, they are treated\nas if they owned and used the property for agricultural purposes\nthroughout the deceased\\'s period of ownership and use. This\n\\'continuous ownership\\' provision allows the surviving spouse or civil\npartner to combine their ownership period with that of the deceased to\nmeet the AR conditions. For instance, if the deceased owned and farmed\nthe land for 15 months, the surviving spouse or civil partner could\nqualify for AR after only nine additional months of ownership and\nfarming.\n\nOther Successive Transfers (s.121 IHTA 1984)**:** For other successive\ntransfers, the \\'continuous ownership\\' concept does not apply. However,\nthe new owner can still potentially qualify for AR without meeting the\nfull ownership period requirement (see 'What is the required period of\nownership?' section above). This is contingent on the original owner\nhaving met all AR conditions at the time of their transfer. The new\nowner can inherit eligibility for AR under certain conditions:\n\nA.  There must be two transfers, with at least one resulting from a\n    > death.\n\nB.  The original transferor must have been eligible for AR at the time\n    > of their transfer.\n\nC.  The property, or a portion of it, must have been transferred to the\n    > second transferor (or their spouse or civil partner) and used for\n    > agricultural purposes at the time of the second transfer. This use\n    > could be by the second transferor or by the estate\\'s personal\n    > representatives if the estate was still in administration.\n\nD.  The only AR eligibility issue for the second transfer should be the\n    > ownership and occupation period requirements (see 'What is the\n    > required period of ownership?'\n\nOccupation of Replacement Property (s.121(2) IHTA 1984)**:** If a\nreplacement property is involved between the two transfers, the\noccupation requirement for AR is transferred to this new property.\nHowever, unless the replacement property resulted from changes in a\npartnership, the value of AR should not exceed what it would have been\nwithout the replacement.\n\n# Planning considerations"

Since all transfers between UK-domiciled spouses or civil partners\n    are exempt from IHT in any event, consideration could be given to\n    leaving agricultural property to other beneficiaries, e.g. children,\n    especially if they work in the business.\n\n> It is however important to note that the spousal exemption is capped\n> at the nil rate band of £325,000 for transfers from a UK-domiciled\n> spouse or civil partner to a non-UK domiciled spouse or civil partner.\n\n2.  Where an individual holds assets that attract AR/BR at 100%, it may\n    be advisable to hold them until death rather than disposing of them\n    during lifetime. This removes the possible capital gains tax charge\n    that can arise on lifetime gifts and may also preserve an income\n    stream for that individual during their life. However, this assumes\n    that the asset would continue to qualify for AR/BR and that the tax\n    regime continues to offer generous AR/BR and a CGT-free uplift to\n    market value on death.\n\n# **Non-statutory clearances** \n\nYou may apply for a non-statutory clearance from HMRC if you are seeking\nconfirmation on the application of tax law to a specific transaction or\nevent, such as qualifying for AR. This service is designed to provide\ncertainty where there is genuine uncertainty about the application of\nthe law.\n\nTo be eligible for a non-statutory clearance, you must meet certain\nconditions. Firstly, you should have fully read the relevant tax\nguidance and legislation concerning AR. If, after doing so, you find\nthat the information you require is not available or you are uncertain\nabout HMRC\\'s interpretation of the tax legislation as it applies to\nyour specific situation, you may then consider requesting a clearance.\n\nWhen applying for a clearance, you should provide comprehensive details\nabout the transaction or event in question. This includes a full\nexplanation of the circumstances, the specific points of uncertainty,\nand how you interpret the relevant tax law in relation to these points.\nIt is crucial to provide all material facts to enable HMRC to give a\nconsidered view.\n\nFor issues relating to AR, HMRC will typically provide clearances where\nthere is material uncertainty over the application of the law and the\nissue is commercially significant to the business. Clearances can be\nprovided for both pre-transaction scenarios, where evidence is supplied\nthat the transaction is genuinely contemplated, and post-transaction\nscenarios.\n\nIn the context of AR, HMRC may provide clearances on various aspects,\nsuch as confirming if a particular transaction would be a scheme\ntransaction, confirming the identity of the vendor and/or purchaser for\na notional land transaction, or confirming the chargeable consideration\nfor a notional transaction.\n\nIt is important to note that HMRC will not provide clearances where\ntransactions are undertaken for the purpose of avoiding tax or where the\nclearance application only requests confirmation of whether AR applies\nor not. Additionally, HMRC will not provide tax planning advice or\nadvice on transactions designed to avoid or reduce a tax charge that\nmight otherwise be expected to arise."

In\nresponse to this, the Government published a consultation from March -\nJune 2023, to gain stakeholders views on the need to update AR, to\nprevent the potential loss of the relief acting as a barrier to the\ninvolvement of agricultural landowners and farmers in the change of land\nuse, under the Environmental Land Management Schemes in England and any\nequivalent schemes across the UK being rolled out to pay for\nenvironmental and climate goods and services.\n\nThe key objective is to ensure that land taken out of agricultural\nproduction permanently or\n\nfor an extended period for this reason does not lose AR.\n\nThis consultation gave stakeholders the opportunity to outline the\ncomplexities surrounding the taxation of ecosystem service markets.\n\nTherefore, recognising the need for greater clarity in this evolving\narea, the Government has decided to establish a collaborative working\ngroup, bringing together expertise from both HM Treasury and HMRC, as\nwell as industry representatives. This working group\\'s mandate will be\nto explore and identify clear, practical solutions that address any\nambiguities in the current law or guidance.

    "chunk_text": "Capital contributions \\[Reviewed 23 January 2024\\]\n\n**Introduction**\n\nA 'capital contribution' is a gratuitous payment - a gift - by one\ncompany to another (generally, but not always, from a parent to its\nwholly owned subsidiary), for nil consideration. The contribution may\ntake the form of cash, or a payment in kind (such as the assumption of a\nliability or the transfer of an asset).\n\nThere are many reasons as to why a company might wish to make a capital\ncontribution. For instance, a parent company might make a capital\ncontribution in order to recapitalise a subsidiary that has experienced\na period of poor financial performance, instead of subscribing for\nadditional share capital (the natural alternative to a contribution,\nparticularly where it is to a directly held subsidiary) or advancing a\nloan.\n\nThe concept of a capital contribution is not recognised by UK Company\nLaw, but they are often recognised within company law regimes in other\nterritories. As such, capital contributions are most commonly seen\nwithin inbound groups, especially US owned businesses.\n\nThere is also no statutory definition of a capital contribution\ncontained within UK tax legislation, although HMRC take the view in\ntheir guidance at\n[[INTM539000]{.underline}](https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/international-manual/intm539000#IDA14BRC)\nthat a capital contribution is *\"An injection of equity into a company,\nin cash or in kind, which increases the equity reserves of a company\nwithout being linked to shares, and which does not generally constitute\ntaxable income for the company or earn a return for the contributor.\"*\n\nAs noted below however, there are a number of circumstances in which the\nreceipt of a capital contribution could be taxable and given that the\ntax treatment of the payment or receipt of a capital contribution by a\nUK company is not specifically covered by UK tax legislation, it is\nnecessary to fully understand the facts surrounding the contribution and\nthen apply general principles of UK tax legislation and case law.\nSpecialist advice must be sought on the Company Law aspects of capital\ncontributions.\n\n**Tax treatment of the receipt of a capital contribution by a UK\ncompany**\n\nThere are a number of possible ways in which the receipt of a capital\ncontribution by a UK company may be taxed:\n\n> i\\. As profits of the trade\n>\n> ii\\. As income not otherwise charged to tax\n>\n> iii\\. As a chargeable gain\n>\n> iv\\. By reducing capital allowances\n>\n> v\\. By reducing management expenses.\n\nAlternatively, if, on the facts, the contribution is a loan rather than\na gift, the loan relationships legislation (Part 5 of CTA 2009) may\napply to the receipt instead.\n\n*Taxation as profits of a trade*\n\nThere is a significant risk that a capital contribution received by a\ntrading company will be taxed as part of its trading profits."

    "chunk_text": "*Taxation as profits of a trade*\n\nThere is a significant risk that a capital contribution received by a\ntrading company will be taxed as part of its trading profits.\n\nCase law has consistently demonstrated that voluntary payments to a\ncompany to help it with certain revenue expenses, supplement its income,\nindemnify its losses, or to enable the company to carry on its business\nor to preserve and maintain trading stability and solvency, are taxable\nas a revenue receipt (for example, ***Smart v Lincolnshire Sugar Co***\nan***d CIR v Falkirk Ice Rink***).\n\nCase law has also extended this principle to a situation where the\ncontribution is being made for an unspecified purpose.\n\nIn the case of ***Ryan v Crabtree Denims***, the High Court held that\nthe general principle behind the case law was that a payment designed:\n\n> \\- To relieve a trader of a specific revenue expense,\n>\n> \\- To supplement the amounts received for its goods or services, or\n>\n> \\- For use in its business as an undifferentiated receipt,\n\n-   \n\nwas taxable as a trading receipt. This was the case even if the payment\nwas a gift to the company, there was no trading relationship between the\ncompanies and no consideration was given by the recipient.\n\nIn this context, 'undifferentiated' refers to a receipt which is\nnon-specific and not expressly for a specific purpose. HMRC guidance at\n[[BIM40451]{.underline}](https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/business-income-manual/bim40451)\nstates that an undifferentiated receipt should be regarded as on revenue\naccount and so this type of receipt is highly likely to be treated as\ntaxable trading income.\n\nThis risk may be mitigated (to some extent) by clear documentation which\nstipulates that the contribution is made to the capital of the company,\nin order to strengthen its balance sheet (instead of, for example, a\nsubscription for new shares), since this is then evidence of the donor's\nintention. However the Courts might still decide that the receipt is\nrevenue in nature, so the risk cannot be eliminated.\n\nSince many capital contributions are made to loss making subsidiaries,\nit's important that, if the donor's intention is to strengthen the\nbalance sheet (and not indemnify the losses) and the contribution is not\nconnected to the losses (e.g. quantum) in any way, that it is documented\nas such. Please see the section on 'Practical steps to reduce the risk\nof taxability' below.\n\n*Taxation as income not otherwise charged*\n\nSection 979 CTA 2009 (previously Schedule D Case VI) taxes income which\nis not otherwise charged to corporation tax."

    "chunk_text": "*Taxation as income not otherwise charged*\n\nSection 979 CTA 2009 (previously Schedule D Case VI) taxes income which\nis not otherwise charged to corporation tax.\n\nThe case of ***Bloom v Kinder*** established that receipts which are not\nreceived under an enforceable contract cannot be taxed by Sch D Case VI.\nIn the majority of cases, capital contributions are unlikely to be made\nby way of an enforceable contract, given that they are generally\ngratuitous in nature and the recipient won't normally be expected to\nprovide any consideration, goods or services in return.\n\nHowever, the difficulty is that the wording of s979 is slightly\ndifferent to that of Sch D Case VI and therefore could potentially be\nwider in scope. Whilst the rewrite of Sch D Case VI into s979 was not\nintended to change the law, several recent cases have taken the view\nthat the wording of predecessor legislation can only be taken into\naccount where the wording of the current legislation is unclear and so\nthis might suggest that the Courts could adopt a different view in\nrespect of s979. As such, the risk of a capital contribution being\ntaxable under s979 cannot be eliminated.\n\n*Taxation as a chargeable gain*\n\nIn theory, the receipt of a capital contribution could be taxed as a\nchargeable gain, but this would only be the case where the recipient has\ndisposed of an identifiable asset in connection with the receipt. In the\nmajority of cases, it is unlikely that the recipient of a capital\ncontribution will be disposing of any kind of asset (given that a\ncapital contribution is typically gratuitous in nature and the recipient\nis not usually expected to provide anything in return) and so it is\nunlikely that the receipt would be taxable in this way.\n\n*Restriction on capital allowances*\n\nA capital contribution could effectively be taxed through a reduction in\nthe availability of capital allowances. Section 532 CAA 2001 states that\na company's expenditure for capital allowance purposes is reduced by the\namount of any third party contribution to its cost, but this rule only\napplies where the donor can also claim allowances (which they won't be\nable to do if the parties are connected) or can otherwise claim tax\nrelief for their contribution (which is also unlikely - see section on\n'Is the payment deductible for corporate tax purposes?' below). As such,\nthe circumstances in which the capital allowances of the recipient would\nbe restricted are likely to be very limited.\n\n*Taxation by reducing management expenses*\n\nSection 1222 CTA 2009 provides that any management expenses of the\ncompany are reduced by the amount of any income derived from sources\nwhich are not charged to tax. To the extent that it is not otherwise\ntaxable, the receipt of a capital contribution may therefore reduce or\neliminate a company's current year management expenses, thus effectively\ntaxing part or all of the capital contribution received. Management\nexpenses cannot be reduced beyond nil.\n\n**Practical steps to reduce the risk of taxability**"

    "chunk_text": "**Practical steps to reduce the risk of taxability**\n\nThere are a number of practical steps, as set out below, which may be\ntaken in order to minimise the risk that a capital contribution is\ntaxable on the recipient but it is important to understand that this\nrisk can never be eliminated completely.\n\n> \\- The contribution should not be connected with any contractual\n> obligation and the recipient should not be obliged to do anything in\n> exchange for the contribution.\n>\n> \\- If the contribution is intended to strengthen the recipient's\n> balance sheet, this should be reflected in the accounting treatment\n> i.e. it would seem preferable for the receipt of the contribution to\n> be credited to reserves rather than to the P&L.\n>\n> \\- The contribution should not be intended to indemnify any historical\n> trading losses otherwise it will be taxable as trading income (note\n> that there is a very narrow distinction between indemnifying losses\n> and strengthening the balance sheet of the recipient).\n>\n> \\- If the intention of the contributor was to inject the funds as\n> capital rather than income and this approach was chosen in preference\n> to a share subscription, documenting as such could help to indicate\n> that the contribution is capital in nature and thus, not taxable.\n\n**Is the payment deductible for corporate tax purposes?**\n\nThere is very limited scope to obtain any tax relief for the payment of\na capital contribution.\n\nA contribution of cash by a UK trading company is unlikely to be tax\ndeductible since the expense will not (usually) be incurred wholly and\nexclusively for the purposes of the payer's trade (s54 CTA 2009). This\nis regardless of the treatment in the hands of the recipient. However,\nit is worth noting that in the special circumstances of ***Lawson v\nJohnson Matthey***, a contribution to an insolvent subsidiary was held\nto be tax deductible since it helped protect the parent company's trade\nand reputation. Likewise, in the case of ***Robinson v Scott Bader\nCo***, the secondment of an employee by a UK company to its struggling\nFrench subsidiary was held to be deductible on the basis that the\nsurvival of the French subsidiary was important for the UK parent to be\nable continue selling its own products.\n\nWhere the payer is an investment company, a contribution is also only\nlikely to be deductible as an expense of management in very limited\ncircumstances (s1219 CTA 2009).\n\n**Chargeable gains and capital allowance implications**\n\n*Contributions of cash*\n\nA capital contribution is unlikely to carry or create any additional\nbase cost. In particular, even if the payer holds existing share capital\nof the recipient, the base cost of those shares will not be increased\ni.e. the donor is not securing any additional rights or value, it is\nmerely making a gift of the funds."

    "chunk_text": "This is because no separate asset is created as a result of making the\ncontribution, nor is the payment reflected in the state or nature of the\nshares (under s38(1)(a) or (b) TCGA 1992). This position was confirmed\nby the Special Commissioners in the case of ***Trustees of Fenston Will\nTrusts v R&C Commissioners***, where it was stated that a capital\ncontribution which is not made as part of the terms of a share issue\n(and which does not enhance the rights and privileges attaching to the\nshares) is not an allowance deduction under s38.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that in HMRC guidance at\n[[CG43502]{.underline}](https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/capital-gains-manual/cg43502),\nit is stated that there could be circumstances (such as when the\nshareholder is required to provide further capital for a particular\nreason or risk loss of entitlement to the shares) where the contribution\nis treated as expenditure under s38(1)(b).\n\nThe absence of good base cost may not be of significant consequence if\nthe substantial shareholdings exemption (SSE) is available, but in other\ncircumstances it could be more tax effective to subscribe for additional\nshare capital in a company, rather than make a capital contribution.\n\n*Contributions in kind*\n\nThe chargeable gains base cost of a contribution in kind paid (in effect\nthe gift of an asset) to a UK company will be the asset's market value\n(s17 TCGA 1992). In addition, for capital allowance purposes, the\nasset's open market value will be used (s14 CAA 2001, subject to s218).\n\nA contribution in kind made by a UK company to an overseas entity is a\ndisposal for chargeable gains purposes, at the asset's market value (s17\nTCGA 1992). The disposal will also be reflected for capital allowances\npurposes - see s61 & s62 CAA 2001.\n\n*Repayment of capital contribution*\n\nThis is very unusual and the consequences uncertain. Generally, the\nrepayment of a capital contribution will probably be treated as income\nakin to a dividend (and not capital) in the hands of a UK company. Since\nthe receipt of dividends by UK companies are generally exempt from\ncorporation tax, there should be no tax implications.\n\nFurthermore, HMRC practice suggests that the receipt of the repayment of\na capital contribution is usually treated as the non-taxable repayment\nof a payment which, when made, was not tax deductible. Accordingly the\nrepayment should be outside the scope of tax."

This paper\nattempts to comprehensively deal with all of the tax issues likely to\narise. It deals both with a UK company making a capital contribution,\nand with the receipt by a UK company of such a contribution.\n\nThe key points include:\n\n-   Capital contributions received by a trading company carry a risk of\n    > being taxed as income.\n\n-   This risk can be mitigated, but not eliminated, with careful, and\n    > advance, planning and documentation.\n\n-   There will be tensions and conflicts between the tax treatments in\n    > the UK, and those of other territories in respect of cross-border\n    > contributions.

What is a \\\"capital contribution\\\"?\n\n### 2.1 General.\n\nWhile the concept of a capital contribution is recognised by company law\nin several overseas jurisdictions, notably the US, it is not addressed\nin UK law, which means the concept is somewhat flexible when applied in\nthe UK. In this paper it is used in its US sense of a payment made to\nanother party for no consideration, i.e. in the nature of a gift, and\nintended to augment that party's capital base. The other party is almost\nalways a wholly owned direct or indirect subsidiary, but not always; it\ncould be a joint venture company where all the shareholders make\npro-rata contributions, or a third party whose liabilities the\ncontributor has guaranteed, or a third party whose continued existence\nis important to the contributor."

    "chunk_text": "Contributions are often made in cash - but can equally be in kind, i.e.\nthe transfer of an asset, or the assumption of a liability. The tax\nconsequences are much the same and any particular distinctions are\nidentified in the paper.\n\n### 2.2 Contingently repayable loans\n\nIt is noted below that the natural alternative to a capital contribution\nis a subscription for shares. However, it is also worth noting that\nthere are in some jurisdictions other alternatives which fall somewhere\nbetween the two, and where the analysis may be different from that set\nout below. In particular, some countries have the idea of a contingently\nrepayable loan. Here, the \"loan\" is never repayable unless and until\ncertain conditions are met, so if they never are, it becomes a capital\ncontribution in the sense above, while if they are, it retrospectively\ndoes look like a loan after all.\n\nThe main differences between the analyses of such a loan and a classic\ncapital contribution are that the contingent obligation to repay it\nmakes it even harder to categorise it as income whether made to a UK\nrecipient or made overseas and coming back into the UK. The only\npotential liability at these points is therefore probably limited to\nforex profits on an outward \"loan\" not made in sterling.\n\nThe additional possible liability though derives from the status of the\npayment outwards as a loan -- could interest be imputed under transfer\npricing principles, in a way which would clearly not be possible for an\noutright contribution? The answer is almost certainly: (a) No, unless\nand until the loan becomes repayable, as it serves an equity function up\nto that time and HMRC apply their established practice of not imputing\ninterest to interest free loans in lieu of equity; and (b) Yes,\nthereafter.\n\n## 3. Why make a capital contribution?\n\nThe natural alternative to a capital contribution is a subscription for\nnew shares (ordinary or preference), so the obvious way of approaching\nthis question is to ask why a parent company might want to make a\ncapital contribution rather than (say) subscribe for new preference\nshares. There are a number of possible answers:\n\nA.  To restore a subsidiary to or towards solvency/to \\'mend a hole\\' in\n    > the balance sheet. This may be for internal reasons, a legal\n    > requirement, or to prepare a subsidiary for sale or liquidation -\n    > there is generally no reason why a share subscription cannot be\n    > used instead, and a capital contribution may be chosen simply\n    > because it is simpler, or (for US parents) out of habit.\n\nB.

An issue of new shares by an overseas subsidiary\nto a UK parent may sometimes not be covered by the General Consents, and\nin such cases using a capital contribution instead to fund the\nsubsidiary should avoid the need for a s765 application. (Note that the\nneed for Treasury Consent is repealed with effect from 1 July 2009 and\nreplaced with a reporting regime for transactions over £100m: arguably\nreducing the incidence of capital contributions made for this reason).\n\nWhat is noteworthy is that the reasons for making a capital contribution\nare NOT generally tax driven; they are commercial. The client is likely\nto want to make such a contribution and needs to be aware of any\npotential tax downsides and whether (and how) they can be avoided or\nminimised. Neither can capital contributions be regarded as some form of\ntax planning technique.\n\nIt might also be noted that capital contributions may be used instead of\nshare issues in tax driven situations because they are equally effective\nand simpler, even if they have no advantages over a share subscription.\nOne example would be where an injection of capital is needed from an\noverseas parent into a UK subgroup to solve a thin capitalisation\nproblem. HMRC may well be indifferent as to whether this is done by way\nof a capital contribution or by way of issuing new shares.\n\n## 4. Is the receipt taxable?"

Is the receipt taxable?\n\n### 4.1 UK trading recipient\n\n#### 4.1.1 The possible routes to taxability\n\nIt is difficult to envisage HMRC arguing that the receipt is taxable as\na chargeable gain - there doesn\\'t seem to be an asset which is disposed\nof - but it is not impossible. Alternatively HMRC may argue that the\nreceipt is taxable either as profits of a trade, or (less plausibly) as\nincome not otherwise charged (s.979 CTA 2009) or that it has some other\ntax consequence making it in effect taxable as income.\n\nEach of these potential routes will be examined in turn, but the initial\nquestion is the categorisation of the receipt for UK tax purposes. Is it\ncapital or revenue? This is a question which cannot be answered\ngenerically - it depends on, among other things, the intentions of the\ndonor. From the analysis below it will be seen that categorisation as\ncapital is generally preferable, and this is why clients are usually\nadvised to document their intention that the payment be of a capital\nnature by calling it a contribution to the capital of the company in\norder to strengthen its balance sheet, and the like.\n\n#### 4.1.2 Taxation as a chargeable gain\n\nCGT is only in point if the recipient has a pre-existing asset, and the\nnatural analysis is that the recipient of a capital contribution has no\nsuch asset, so that TCGA 1992 is not in point. Strictly, one could argue\nthat immediately before the contribution is received, the recipient must\nknow about it, and the promise to give it could, on the basis of [[Zim\nProperties v\nProcter]{.underline}](https://library.croneri.co.uk/cch_uk/btc/1985-btc-42?highlight=1),\nbe a capital gains asset. However, such a right (unlike the enforceable\ncontractual rights in Zim itself) is probably not enforceable for lack\nof consideration where there is none, and it is unlikely therefore to be\na CGT \"asset\" and in practice, given the terms of [[ESC\nD33,]{.underline}](https://library.croneri.co.uk/cch_uk/btl/esc-it-esc-d33)\nthe point is extremely unlikely even to be raised.\n\nHMRC manuals have limited comments on this area at [[CG\n43500]{.underline}](https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/capital-gains-manual/cg43500).\n\n#### 4.1.3 Taxation as income not otherwise charged (s.979 CTA 2009)"

There is a full discussion of the extent\nof s.979 in this [[Technical\nPaper]{.underline}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hwGd-SJyFNn3YzcUJ2_eEL2h-JPyJrW5fF_-F2iQCVM/edit?usp=sharing).\nThe key issue is that s.979 is subtly different to the old Case VI. In\nparticular s.979 taxes \\\"income that is not otherwise within the\napplication of \\[the charge to corporation tax\\]\\\" with specific\nexceptions, whereas Case VI taxed \\\"any annual profits or gains not\nfalling under any other Case of Sch D\\\", and the implication of a source\nin the words \\\"annual profits or gains\\\" led the courts to narrow the\nscope of Case VI considerably. We cannot be certain that a court would\nimpose similar limits on s.979, should the point ever be litigated, and\n2013 case law does suggest that s.979 might be wider than we would hope\n([[Eclipse Film\nPartners]{.underline}](https://library.croneri.co.uk/cch_uk/btc/2016-btc-20?highlight=1)).\n\n[[Bloom v\nKinder]{.underline}](https://library.croneri.co.uk/cch_uk/btc/38-tc-77?highlight=1)\nstrongly suggests that receipts which are not received under an\nenforceable contract cannot be taxed under what was Case VI. This is a\ngood reason why any agreement to make a capital contribution should not\nbe documented in writing in advance; but even if it is, this should not\nbe a problem provided the recipient does not agree to do anything in\nreturn, as a purely gratuitous promise to give money is not legally\nenforceable when not in the form of a deed. What should be avoided is a\nwritten agreement to make the contribution if the recipient agrees to do\nsomething in return, e.g. to continue to trade for a period, or use it\nfor a specified purpose, or the like. Even then, s.979 is thought\nunlikely, as all the cases have involved the recipient providing solid\nservices of some sort to the donor, which would not be the case with a\ncapital contribution, but it becomes at least a slight risk.\n\n#### 4.1.4 Taxation as profits of a trade\n\nThis is perhaps the most commonly encountered scenario. There are a\nnumber of cases where receipts which were paid in order to supplement\nthe trading income of the recipient, without the trader providing\nanything specific in return to the payer, have been held to be taxable."

    "chunk_text": "#### 4.1.5 Receipt effectively taxed by reducing capital allowances\n\nEven if a capital contribution received by a trader is accepted as not\nbeing revenue in nature, and as not creating a chargeable gain, it may\nstill in effect be taxable if it is taken into account to reduce a\ndeduction which would otherwise be due to the trader. This is perfectly\npossible via the capital allowances code. If the capital receipt is\nregarded as allocated specifically to cover given capital costs which\nare in principle eligible for capital allowances, s.532 CAA 2001 says\nthat the company's expenditure for capital allowances purposes is to be\nregarded as reduced by the amount of the contribution to those costs.\nHowever, this is subject to s.536, which says that contributions from\nother companies which cannot get either a capital allowance or a tax\ndeduction for their contribution are to be ignored. S.537(2)(c) provides\nthat the contributor can never get a capital allowance for his\ncontribution if he and the recipient are connected persons, as will\nalmost invariably be the case where capital contributions are concerned.\nThis appears to mean that s.532 will in practice never cause the\nrecipient to have its capital allowances restricted.\n\nIt is conceivable that in very limited circumstances a capital\ncontribution could still have capital allowances effects, such as where\nit takes the form of a payment for an asset so that the recipient never\nincurs the expenditure at all, or where under Vodafone the payer gets a\ndeduction for it, but these are likely to be very rare indeed.\n\n#### 4.1.6 Other possibilities\n\nIn specific fact patterns there may be other avenues to taxation. For\nexample, if a subsidiary owes the parent money for goods or services\nsupplied, and the parent makes a capital contribution which is used to\npay that debt, HMRC could conceivably argue that the reality of the\nsituation was that the trade debt was released, leading to the\ncontribution being taxed as a loan relationship profit under s.354 CTA\n2009 (or s.94 CTA 2009 for a formal release between unconnected\nparties).\n\n#### 4.1.7 Accounting (and a practical point re inbound share schemes & FRS20)\n\nFor a trading company, s.46 CTA 2009 states that the accounts should be\nfollowed in computing profits, unless a legal rule requires or allows\notherwise. Accordingly, it is very important that a capital contribution\nshould if possible be accounted for otherwise than as an addition to\nprofit passing through the P&L account - this will make it much easier\nto argue that the payment should not be regarded as taxable as a trade\nprofit."

    "chunk_text": "One interesting point to consider is in the case of inbound groups where\nthe overseas parent company provides share based compensation to its UK\nsubsidiary, and there is no recharge agreement in place. In the books of\nthe UK company, the share scheme results in an accounting charge based\non FRS20/IFRS2 principles, with the corresponding credit being treated\nas a capital contribution booked to reserves on the balance sheet. Of\ncourse in the situation where a recharge agreement is in place, and the\nrecharge agreement is based on the FRS20 accounting charge for the UK\nsubsidiary, then the corresponding credit would be to intra-group\nliabilities.\n\nIn the case where there is no recharge agreement and there is a credit\nto reserves, it is interesting to consider whether the credit could be\nviewed as a taxable capital contribution by HMRC. Whilst there would not\nseem to be any experience of HMRC pursuing this point in practice, it is\npossible to see how HMRC could compile some compelling arguments on the\nmatter. As mentioned above, the best defence strategy is (subject to\noverseas tax considerations) to ensure that there is a recharge\nagreement in place which ensures that the share scheme is not seen as a\nbenefit for the company.\n\nWe are also aware of a number of other scenarios where transactions may\nbe accounted for as involving a capital contribution such as where, in\ncertain circumstances, RDEC is surrendered to another group company for\nno consideration. When determining the tax treatment of these 'deemed'\ncapital contributions, the same analysis as set out above is likely to\napply. However, it is important to be aware that capital contributions\n(from an accounting perspective) can arise in circumstances where they\nmight not immediately be expected and so identifying such capital\ncontributions, along with determining the appropriate analysis, will be\ncrucial.\n\n### 4.2 Receipt by UK company with investment business\n\n#### 4.2.1 Taxation as capital or under s.979\n\nWhat has been said above concerning the fact that a contribution\ncharacterised as capital rather than revenue is very unlikely to be\ntaxable, whether as a capital sum derived from an asset or by\nrestricting capital allowances (see 4.1.2 and 4.1.5 above) apply equally\nhere, as do the comments on s.979 in 4.1.3, but clearly those related to\ntrade profits (at 4.1.4, 4.1.6 and 4.1.7) do not. Neither the capital\nnor \\'other income\\' route is likely to result in taxation of the\nreceipt.\n\n#### 4.2.2 Taxation as income under s.1222 CTA 2009\n\nHowever, a different, and often overlooked, route to taxability opens up\nshould the contribution be regarded as revenue (i.e. income) rather than\ncapital in nature. S.1222 CTA 2009 provides that management expenses\nshould be reduced by the amount of any income derived from sources not\ncharged to tax. And this would appear to cover contributions of a\nvoluntary nature made by other group companies."

Certainly\ns.1222 does not extend to making the excess of the contribution over the\nyear's management expenses assessable profit of the year (unlike the\ncase of the trader where a contribution could create a positive trading\nprofits assessment).\n\nThere appears to be no way in which future years\\' expenses are capable\nof being affected.

The principles should be no different if it is made in the\nform of a contribution of assets, but there will be a valuation issue\n(what is the quantum of the contribution if taxable?) and the form of\nthe capital contribution may make it more or less likely that it can be\ntaxed in a certain way. For example, if it is the shares of a company,\nwhich would have to be held as a fixed asset outside the trade, and\nwould be difficult to sell easily, this makes trading profit treatment\nunlikely. Conversely, if it is a gift of machinery which will be used in\nthe trade, or of trading stock, this looks more like a contribution\nwithin the Falkirk Ice Rink principle considered at part 4.1.4 above.\n\nThe main additional tax issues arising out of contributions in kind are\nlikely to be the tax basis which the UK company takes in the asset\ngifted to it, which is discussed in part 5 below.\n\n### 4.5 Practical steps to reduce the risk of taxability\n\nIf the client has decided upon making a capital contribution to a UK\ncompany, rather than subscribing for new shares, what practical steps\ncan be taken to reduce the risks of the contribution being taxed in any\nof the ways outlined above?\n\nWhatever the status of the recipient, if the intention of the\ncontributor is to inject the funds as capital rather than as income then\nthis should be clearly documented, and it is preferable that the\nrecipient recognises this intention as well. The preferred accounting is\nthat the contribution be credited to \"other reserves\" rather than to\nprofit & loss account.\n\nIt goes without saying that the documentation must always reflect the\ntrue intentions of the parties, and must never be worded in a certain\nway in an effort to secure a given tax result if that wording is not a\nproper indication of what will actually be done.\n\nIn particular, capital contributions tend to be made to loss-making\nsubsidiaries, and such companies will use additions to their capital\nbase to fund their trading, so there is a relatively narrow difference\nbetween an intention to increase such a trader's capital and an\nintention to indemnify its losses.\n\nNonetheless the difference exists, and once the contributor has\nconfirmed its intention to support the trader's capital, objective\nevidence of that intention might take the form of action to reduce any\nlinkage to the losses. To reduce the degree to which the contributions\nlook like income it is preferable to have one-off contributions rather\nthan recurrent ones, and for the amount to be one which can't be\nrecognised as an accounts loss.\n\nThere should also be no agreement in advance about the making of a\ncontribution to offset the effect of losses, as this will clearly\nincrease the risk of income treatment.\n\nFinally, there should be nothing to indicate that the recipient is\nobliged to do anything for the payer in return for getting the capital\ncontribution, to minimise any risk of s.979 applying.\n\n## 5.

This amount may be limited to the giver's\nown capital expenditure under s.218, but this will seldom be less than\nthe market value when donated to the UK subsidiary, so s.218 should\nseldom bite.\n\n### 5.2 Contributions in kind by UK companies -- a CGT/CA disposal?\n\nShould a UK company make such a contribution to an overseas subsidiary,\nthis will be treated as a non-arm\\'s length disposal for CGT and CA\npurposes. So the market value of the asset will have to be brought into\nthe CGT computation via s.17 (with any loss being a connected party loss\nwithin s.18) and the disposal value to be brought into the CA pool where\nappropriate will also be the market value of the asset or the\nacquisition cost if lower via s.61(1)(a) CAA 2001, points 2 or 7 in the\ntable at s.61(2), and s.62(1).\n\n### 5.3 Contributions in cash by UK companies -- no extra UK CGT base cost?\n\nWhere a contribution is made by a UK parent to a subsidiary, there is\nnormally no additional CGT base cost when the subsidiary is later sold,\nalthough the importance of this point will have greatly diminished since\nApril 2002 with the introduction of substantial shareholdings relief."

    "chunk_text": "The reason why there is no such additional base cost is because the\ncontribution affects only the value of the shares in the recipient, and\ncreates no separate asset, nor is it reflected in the \"state or nature\"\nof the shares when sold, so that it does not satisfy the requirements of\ns.38(1)(a) or (b) TCGA 1992. This view was shared by tax counsel in\nseveral consultations in the 1980s. HMRC also agree with this analysis\nin their manual at [[CG\n43502]{.underline}](https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/capital-gains-manual/cg43502)\nand it was confirmed in the Special Commissioners decision in the case\nof [[Trustees of Fenston Will\nTrusts]{.underline}](https://library.croneri.co.uk/cch_uk/btc/2007-spc-589?highlight=1).\nHowever, HMRC do say that in the unusual case where a shareholder can\nlose his shares if he doesn't make the contribution, a CGT deduction\nwill then often be available under s.38(1)(b), and that a deduction will\nbe available under s.38(1)(a) where a capital contribution is made at\nthe same time as a share subscription or otherwise as part of the terms\nof a share issue. Prior to the Fenston Wills Trusts case the manuals did\nimply that there may be some hope of concessionary treatment in other\ncases. CG 43503/4 said that Inspectors should refer cases to Solihull\nwhere the lack of CGT base cost \"distorts\" the tax result as well as\nwhere the point is argued by the taxpayer, implying that extra base cost\nmay well be conceded in plain vanilla cases where no avoidance is\nconcerned. This concessionary treatment appears to have disappeared in\nthe rewritten manuals following the Fenston Wills case.\n\nWe're aware, at March 2019, that another firm and counsel have advised\nin a specific circumstance that a capital contribution may add to base\ncost - [[see\nhere]{.underline}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GM_K_AwHzf-teiLTWjafySaWkyOJNQvGyLAG6pBc8zc/edit?usp=sharing)\nfor further detail.\n\n### 5.4 Could a capital contribution ever be deductible to a UK payer?\n\nAlmost always the answer will be NO. If the payer is an investment\ncompany it won't be an expense of management since it will form part of\nthe carrying cost of the investment (following the [[Sun Life Assurance\nSociety v\nDavidson]{.underline}](https://library.croneri.co.uk/cch_uk/btc/37-tc-330?highlight=1)\ncase) and if the payer is a trader it won't be wholly and exclusively\nfor the purposes of its trade and anyway will generally be a capital\ncost."

{
    "doc_name": "Capital contributions_ Technical paper - Pilot.docx",
    "chunk_text": "However, there will be rare exceptions. If the payer is a trader and the\nfailure of the subsidiary would damage its own trade, a deduction may be\npossible, as it was in [[Lawson v Johnson\nMatthey]{.underline}](https://library.croneri.co.uk/cch_uk/btc/1992-btc-324?highlight=1),\nwhere a £50m contribution to an insolvent banking subsidiary to let it\nbe taken over in a Bank of England rescue was deductible because it\nhelped preserve the parent's reputation and thus its precious metals\ntrade. But such cases will be rare - if the subsidiary is solvent, the\npayment will be partly to increase its value so that the wholly &\nexclusively test will generally be failed.\n\nAnother exception was [[Robinson v Scott Bader\nCo]{.underline}](https://library.croneri.co.uk/cch_uk/btc/54-tc-757?highlight=1),\nwhere an employee was seconded at its own cost by the UK parent to a\nstruggling French subsidiary, the sale of whose products was important\nto the sale of the parent's own products in France. It was held that the\nUK parent's costs were allowable, and the same would presumably have\nbeen true had it aided the subsidiary by way of a cash payment to let it\nhire similar expertise. The fact that there may be ancillary benefits to\nsubsidiaries' trades does not always mean the wholly & exclusively test\nis failed if the preponderant purpose is to help the UK trade, as the\nHouse of Lords later confirmed in [[Vodafone Cellular v\nShaw]{.underline}](https://library.croneri.co.uk/cch_uk/btc/1997-btc-247?highlight=1).\n\nThere is no recorded case of a capital contribution being deductible as\na management expense, although one can envisage equally rare cases where\nsuch a claim might succeed, e.g. where the contribution is to a group\nservices company which is itself carrying out a group administrative or\nmanagerial role.\n\n## 6. How are repayments treated?\n\n*UK company repaying the contribution*\n\nThere are two possible treatments of the repayment - as capital or as\nincome. However, as no shares are issued in return for a capital\ncontribution, the contribution will not add to the company\\'s\n\\\"capital\\\" for s.1000 purposes, and the repayment is therefore almost\ncertain to be regarded as wholly income.\n\nThis would not be the case:\n\n\\(a\\) where the subsidiary was in liquidation, as s.1000 does not apply\nto distributions in a liquidation, or\n\n\\(b\\) the parent had the contribution \\\"repaid\\\" by a redemption of some\nof the shares it was paid in respect of, when the normal s.1000\n\\\"mixed\\\" income & capital treatment would follow, or\n\n\\(c\\) the parent had the contribution \\\"repaid\\\" by reducing the\ncompany\\'s capital."

    "chunk_text": "\\(c\\) the parent had the contribution \\\"repaid\\\" by reducing the\ncompany\\'s capital.\n\nHowever, in all other cases full income treatment is likely, but this\nwon\\'t have any consequences of note for corporate shareholders, as\ndividends paid from one UK company to another are exempt due to Part 9A\nCTA 2009. In practice, even if part of the repayment is treated as\ncapital, adverse consequences for the recipient are highly unlikely.\nCapital contributions from individuals are almost unknown in practice,\nso the potential Sch F and IHT consequences of a repayment to such a\nshareholder are not considered here.\n\nShould a UK company repay a capital contribution received from a foreign\nparent, overseas tax consequences will obviously also need\nconsideration. Any forex gain or loss should have no UK tax effects as\nit will be treated as arising on the contribution, which will already\nhave been agreed as non-taxable (or not, as the case may be).\n\n*Non-UK company repaying the contribution*\n\nHere the risk is that if it is of an income nature, the refund might be\ntaxable under s.979 (s.933 can\\'t bite as it only taxes \\\"dividends\\\"\nreceived from foreign companies), while if it is of a capital nature, it\nmight be a capital gains part disposal.\n\nFirst the UK courts have to decide if the repayment is capital or income\nin nature - only if they can\\'t do so on first principles (e.g. using\nthe Tree & Fruit analogy) do they need to consider overseas\ngeneral/company law to discover exactly what is being done and how to\ncharacterise it ([[Lord Inchyra v\nJennings]{.underline}](https://library.croneri.co.uk/cch_uk/btc/42-tc-388?highlight=1),\nand e.g. [[Courtaulds Investments Ltd V\nFleming]{.underline}](https://library.croneri.co.uk/cch_uk/btc/46-tc-111?highlight=1)).\n\nIt is not intuitively clear what the character of the repayment is, so\nthe probability is that the overseas general law would in practice\ndecide if it was income or capital. This means that if the strict law\nwas applied by HMRC (or the courts) a serious problem could arise if the\nreceipt was treated as income and there was little or no DTR to offset\nthe tax, or if it was treated as a capital distribution, when an\nappreciable gain would be likely to arise, unless substantial\nshareholdings relief was available."

    "chunk_text": "In reality, though, the characterisation may not matter much, so far as\nUK law is concerned, because HMRC have said that subject to any\nWestmoreland considerations they would by concession not generally\nregard such a repayment as giving rise either to a CGT receipt nor to\n\\[Case V\\] income, but would treat it as a non-taxable repayment of a\nnon-allowable payment. This rather generous approach is set out in the\nattached precedent\n[[KMI2008.00229950]{.underline}](https://drive.google.com/a/pwc.com/file/d/1EShdOVLTBt9e4GPiOYAp3WexZIVTOAgb/view?usp=sharing) -\nit is old (1985), but there is nothing to indicate that HMRC practice\nhas changed.\n\nAfter the introduction of substantial shareholdings relief, a capital\nreceipt generally wouldn't trigger any UK tax liability anyway, so the\nmain danger would be HMRC not applying their usual concessionary\npractice and contending that the repayment constituted income, which,\nnot being a dividend, would probably attract no DTR.\n\nUnder CTSA the best filing position if such a repayment is received, and\nis considered to be of an income nature rather than capital, is probably\nto treat the receipt as non-taxable but to explain clearly in a note to\nthe return that this treatment is based on HMRC's practice of regarding\nsuch receipts as outside the scope. But the client should be made aware\nof the technical risk of an income exposure before the repayment is\nmade, to e.g. let the group consider alternatives such as a\nreorganisation and liquidation to fall within the substantial\nshareholdings exemption.\n\nSo far as forex differences are concerned, these will be included in any\nincome, in the unlikely event that it arises. The foreign currency\nactually received will need to be translated at spot rates to quantify\nthe income. If the receipt is treated as a capital receipt, strictly a\n(further) capital gain attributable to forex could arise, if the foreign\ncurrency has appreciated by more than indexation and substantial\nshareholdings relief is not available - the reasoning in [[Bentley v\nPike]{.underline}](https://library.croneri.co.uk/cch_uk/btc/53-tc-590?highlight=1)\nwould be relevant. But in practice HMRC are likely to treat the receipt\nas a tax \"nothing\" and in this case their treatment would surely extend\nto any forex gains.\n\n## 7 Other issues\n\n### 7.1 Charities"

HMRC have confirmed\n(Talisman, FTP98.0346 - old correspondence, no longer available) that a\ncapital contribution to a trading subsidiary is not automatically caught\nand said that a specific application should be made to them, when they\nwould be sympathetic (save maybe where the deficit arose from\nnon-allowable costs like entertaining). This is contrary to the advice\nof a QC specialising in charities, (cf TTC BRI35.06 on Talisman - old\ncorrespondence, no longer available) that no specific application is\nneeded. But it appears unlikely that there should be a problem in\npractice.\n\n### 7.2 VAT\n\nA gratuitous gift to another company, not in return for any services,\nwill generally be outside the scope of VAT completely and so will have\nno VAT consequences at all. But John Holt (Nov 2014) reports that this\nissue needs real care - he has seen examples of Midco\\'s (who are not\nyet in a VAT group) assuming no VAT consequences for a capital\ncontribution, yet the documentation referred to the contribution being\nmade \\'in consideration of the obligations accepted by Bidco\\' arguably\ncreating a taxable supply and converting a contribution into a supply."

    "chunk_text": "***Exempt elected fund ceasing to meet UK property rich test - July\n2022***\n\n*Exemption election overview*\n\nBroadly, the principle underpinning the fund exemption election is that\ndirect and indirect disposals of UK property are exempted from UK tax on\ncapital gains but that the repatriation of those gains to the ultimate\ninvestors are then taxable (subject to any exemptions/special status\nthose investors may have). In addition, where there is a disposal of\nshares in a UK property rich company out of an exempt elected fund,\nthere may be a 'step up' in the base cost for capital gains purposes of\nany UK property/UK property rich shares held by that company.\n\nHowever, the benefit of these exemptions/step ups may not always be\navailable where the conditions for the fund exemption subsequently cease\nto be met. In particular, the 'UK property rich' condition and\npotentially other conditions can cease to be met earlier than\nanticipated.\n\nIn addition to the election ceasing to have effect, there will be a\ndeemed disposal immediately prior to the UK property rich test ceasing\nto be met by the investors in the exempt elected fund. This deemed\ndisposal, at a time when the UK property rich test is still met, is\nintended to ensure that the UK will still have taxing rights over any\ngain under the terms of any relevant tax treaty. However, the gain on\nthe deemed disposal may not be taxable on the investors until a later\ndate depending on the particular circumstances.\n\nNotwithstanding the deemed disposal at the investor level, for certain\nother purposes the fund exemption may, in particular circumstances, be\ntreated as continuing to have effect, where the fund is expected to\nbecome UK property rich at a later date. There are also provisions that\napply where steps are being taken to wind up the fund (these provisions\nare not covered in this note (para 30 Sch 5AAA TCGA 1992)),\n\nDepending on the specific facts and circumstances, potential negative\nconsequences can be mitigated, but care needs to be exercised when\nwinding up a fund to avoid unexpected outcomes.\n\nThere are other conditions relating to the fund exemption (eg the\nnon-close tax condition) which may also cease to be met. In those cases\nthe consequences for the company being disposed of, the company making\nthe disposal and the investors in the fund may be different and are not\ncovered here.\n\n*Property rich condition*"

When considering this 75% test\nthe company should take into account all assets the company itself holds\nas well as the assets of any company it directly or indirectly holds\nshares in (for example cash, loan receivables etc). However, if an asset\nis matched to a liability of a related party (as defined) then it should\nnot be counted. This would mean, for example, that a loan receivable is\nnot treated as a non-property asset where the borrower is a related\nparty. The test does not take into account any liabilities in the\ncompany itself, or any company it owns (directly or indirectly).\n\nThere are a number of scenarios in which ceasing to meet the UK property\nrich condition can arise, very broadly because a closed ended fund is\nbeing wound up and assets are sold at different times, resulting in a\nreduction in the proportion of its value arising from property and an\nincrease the proportion of its value attributable to other assets (i.e.\nthe cash consideration received on sale). Even where the cash is\nimmediately repatriated to investors, the breach will still have\noccurred.\n\nBy way of example, where there is a holding company (\\\"HoldCo\\\") that\nholds 2 property rich companies (\\\"PropCos\\\") with UK properties of\nequal value of £50m, and debt in place in the case of each propco of\n£30m to be refinanced following the sale. If HoldCo sold one of the\npropcos then HoldCo would have £20m in cash and would have £50m in UK\nproperty assets (i.e. the gross value of the assets held in the\nremaining propco). This would result in HoldCo having 28.7% of its\nassets in cash and 71.3% of its assets in UK property. Therefore, it\nwould fail the 75% test and no longer be UK property rich. This would be\nthe case even if the cash were distributed out of HoldCo shortly\nafterwards, since at a point in time, the 75% test would not have been\nmet.\n\nThe key scenarios in which an exempt elected fund is likely to cease to\nmeet the UK property rich condition are as follows:\n\n1.

The sale of shares should qualify for SSE (TCGA\n1992 Sch 7AC para 15A and paras 19(2A)-(2C)) and any degrouping charges\nare either added to the SSE exempt disposal proceeds (TCGA assets) or\ndisapplied (intangible fixed assets).\n\nCommercially the vendor will often not want to transfer the trade and\nassets into the NewCo until i) it knows the sale will go ahead; and ii)\nas close to the sale as possible.\n\nThis always raises the concern that beneficial ownership of the NewCo\nshares will have been lost before the trade and asset transfer occurs.\nSection 1.2.4 of the [[Transfer of trade technical\npaper]{.underline}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZzWX2sqVxj9g6VamJOd6vzB0rgazyzc1RD5qkxXExIM/edit#heading=h.neb7j7jqklks)\ndiscusses the issue where there is a contractual agreement to sell the\nNewCo shares before it owns the relevant assets. The broad conclusion is\nthat providing the legal documentation is very clear that the sale of\nthe NewCo shares cannot happen before the trade and assets transfer,\nthat HMRC will respect that order of events, but for certainty it may be\nbetter to sell NewCo via options.\n\nThe technical paper discusses the issue from the perspective of the\nownership condition in the CTA 2010 Part 22 rules regarding transfers of\ntrade without a change of ownership, and the tax neutral asset transfer\nprovisions of TCGA 1992 s171 and CTA 2009 s775. The SSE provisions also\nbring in an additional consideration, as one of the conditions to be met\nfor the sale of NewCo to qualify for SSE is that, at the time of\ndisposal of NewCo, NewCo is using an asset transferred to it from\nanother group company, for the purposes of a trade carried on by NewCo.\nThat raises the question as to how long does NewCo need to be trading\nfor before the sale of NewCo?\n\nThe following **question** was asked:"

The question we\\'re working through is\nwhether we can get para 15A of Sch 7AC to apply. The concern is because\nthe lawyers are adamant the transfer of assets and sale of the company\nreceiving those assets happens on the same day and essentially\nimmediately after one another so how can we be comfortable that para 15A\ncan be met?\n\nCould we get your view on the firm\\'s level of comfort when the transfer\nand sale is so close together and there isn\\'t a clear week (or more)\nperiod which would ensure para 15A(2)(b) is met. Is it standard practice\nHMRC wouldn\\'t challenge the application of para 15A(2)(b) in this sort\nof circumstance? Could we get to a MLTN position?\n\n**Responses**:\n\n1 We have experience of para 15A(2)(b) in the context of a due\ndiligence. The group had an HMRC challenge on a transfer where the trade\n& assets were transferred a few weeks prior to closing (but with a\n\\'bounceback\\' clause so that the trade would go back to the original\ncompany if the deal did not complete). The buyer moved the assets out\ninto its main trader the same day of closing. As closing was on a\nweekend, even though a positive SSE clearance had already been obtained,\nHMRC challenged heavily that the trade was never beneficially carried\nout by the entity and it looked like going to court (insurers were\npricing insurance at 10% of the exposure). Our view is that there\\'s a\nreal practical risk of challenge if your client doesn\\'t have at least a\nday of clear trading both pre and post and those days should be trading/\nworkdays.\n\n2 We looked at para 15A(2)(b) for a retailer last year. The trade was\ntransferred to the company being sold at 8am and its shares were sold at\nthe end of trading, (6pm) that day. It was written into the agreements\nvery very clearly i.e. the business transfer agreement specified 8am and\nthe share purchase agreement specified 6pm. And it was a weekday so the\nshops definitely opened!\n\nBoth responses agree that you need at least a trading day where there\nhas been meaningful commercial operations and activity. Obviously the\nlonger the better if that can be achieved commercially.\n\nFor further detail re para 15A see section 10 of the [[SSE Technical\npaper]{.underline}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Dz3dlzCFEZMWQxSkBdvlp62XmfNHM2TF9_yDAfJxhHw/edit#heading=h.e1y5fabor4p1)."

Without getting into the specifics of the\nCIOT submission, Loans to Participators is certainly a hot topic in UK\ntax due diligence. A recent PwC Deals Tax Partner & Director technical\ndiscussion covered this, here are a few points which might be of\ninterest:\n\n-   Refresher: these rules are typically in point for Private Equity\n    Backed companies because they will be \\\"close\\\" companies because of\n    the requirement to aggregate investors coming in from a partnership.\n\n-   There is a common misconception that Loans to Participators charges\n    only apply to upstream loans - there is nothing in the legislation\n    to this effect. It can apply to any loan/advance of money or\n    conferred benefit made by a close company either directly or\n    indirectly to a participator who is a relevant person.

As a practical point HMRC does not allow the offset of a s.455\n        charge against a CT liability. Given the long lead time for\n        s.455 to be repaid by HMRC (9 months after the end of the period\n        the loan has been repaid) there is a timing /cash flow\n        consideration in a Deals Context;\n\n    2.  Generally, when a loan is due to be repaid on the transaction,\n        HMRC would likely accept that the s.455 charge would not need to\n        be paid; however late payment interest would be charged (this\n        can be a material sum).\n\nThe CIOT submission to the HMRC\\'s Business Assets and International\nteam ends; \\\"we would be interested in your views on the issue we have\nraised in this letter and in discussing possible options with you, such\nas an amendment to HMRC's manuals or changes to the legislation. Please\nnote that we intend to publish this letter and HMRC's response on our\nwebsite\\\".\n\n**Off payroll workers (IR35) - more court cases, refresher for UK\nDeals.**\n\nThere have been a number of recent high profile IR35 tax cases involving\nTV and radio presenters with mixed results. In some cases HMRC have been\nsuccessful in arguing that these individuals should have paid large sums\nof tax due to them being 'deemed employees' for tax purposes under a\nhypothetical contract between the individual themselves and the end user\nthey are providing services to (effectively ignoring the existence of\nthe Personal Services Company \"PSC\"). Leaving aside the celebrity aspect\n(sadly...), off payroll workers is a perennial hot topic, so this seems\nas good a time as any for a refresher on how these provisions come up in\nUK Deals.\n\nThe first (and perhaps most obvious one) is as an issue in tax due\ndiligence:\n\n-   Broadly a UK DD Target will usually be required to apply IR35\n    (payments via PSCs) rules where it is the end-client, i.e. where it\n    is paying the PSC (we've ignored the exemption for \"small\" companies\n    for simplicity). This means the UK DD Target is required to assess\n    employee status, issue Status Determination Statements, and if\n    reasonable care is not taken, be responsible for any PAYE and NIC\n    underpayments, as well as associated penalties. As a reminder of the\n    rules prior to 6 April 2021:\n\n    -   Where a business engaged with a UK PSC for services, a contract\n        was in place with the PSC and the PSC received payments for\n        services, any payroll withholding obligation would rest with the\n        PSC; and\n\n    -   Similarly, where a UK based employment agency was engaged and\n        payment was made to the agency (rather than the individual or\n        PSC directly), all payroll withholding obligations rested with\n        the agency."

    "chunk_text": "-   Similarly, where a UK based employment agency was engaged and\n        payment was made to the agency (rather than the individual or\n        PSC directly), all payroll withholding obligations rested with\n        the agency.\n\n-   There has always been a requirement to assess self-employed sole\n    traders (i.e. individuals considered not to be employees and paid\n    directly, not via a PSC) for employment status for tax purposes. The\n    risk in this regard extends back 6 closed tax years (i.e. if we were\n    carrying out a DD today we'd be going back to 6 April 2018) plus the\n    current tax year (2024/25).\n\n-   At their core, the UK off payroll worker provisions are well\n    established. They seek to remove the arbitrage from not having to\n    operate payroll withholding (and pay employer NIC of 13.8% and, if\n    relevant, Apprenticeship Levy of 0.5%) unless the engagements are\n    deemed to be with genuine freelancers. That said, the devil is in\n    the detail, and determining employment status is complex as there is\n    no statutory test (hence court cases referred to above). This has\n    attracted a lot of commentary in the press.\n\n-   In a tax due diligence context, the amount of tax potentially at\n    stake can be very material, and is increased further when interest\n    and penalties are added on. While there are nuances by sector/size\n    (e.g. let's ignore tech start-ups), for companies with material off\n    payroll workers, best practice would be to have a documented process\n    to assess whether an individual is genuinely a freelancer before\n    said individual can actually be engaged. This would usually be based\n    on HMRC's Check Employment Status for Tax (CEST) tool and integrated\n    into HR/legal/recruitment teams, not just tax. Such a process does\n    not guarantee that a Group has correctly determined employment\n    status in each case, but it does give something which can be\n    provided in acquisition due diligence /an HMRC check. If this is not\n    already in place and a transaction is in the offing, it is something\n    which could be considered in a vendor assist project.\n\nSecond (and perhaps sometimes missed?) is as part of the tax structuring\nworkstream when it comes to bringing in external directors. E.g. a PE\nHouse plans to bring in an individual with experience in the sector to\nact as the chair of the UK Group post acquisition. Someone suggests that\nthe chair might like to be paid off payroll. What needs to be considered\nfrom an off-payroll workers angle (ignoring VAT etc)?\n\n1.  Officerholders (e.g. a chair and other non-executive directors\n    (\"NEDs\") are by default employees for UK tax purposes\\*. So the\n    default is that payments for the role should be subject to PAYE and\n    NIC (and processed via payroll)."

We do see situations where there are two contracts in place, one for\n    the NED role (paid via the payroll and subject to employment tax)\n    and a separate consultancy contract (paid gross to a PSC). However,\n    this approach only works if there is genuinely a separate\n    consultancy role. The Group will also still have an ongoing\n    obligation to undertake a CEST assessment for the consultancy\n    role/PSC to ensure the role is outside of IR35 and fees can be paid\n    gross.\n\nThese situations can be sensitive. 1) above is the helpful starting\npoint, 2) shows perhaps a best case scenario assuming these are\ngenuinely the facts. In the above, we have ignored overseas matters\nwhich can create a lot of complications.\n\n\\*There is an exemption where PE houses appoint directors directly to\nthe board, providing the money goes to the PE house and not the\ndirector, and PE house is in UK remit.

The March article focussed on obtaining tax\nvaluations to support the value at which shares are issued, in order to\nmitigate potential tax (and due diligence) risks.\n\nIn addition to robust and contemporaneous tax valuations, we wanted to\ntake the opportunity to remind each other of additional best practice\nactions which we recommend are adopted in respect of employment related\nsecurities. If you'd like to discuss this further please get in touch\nand we can organise a discussion with a tax valuations colleague.\n\n*Share issuances*\n\n-   We always recommend a review where there's an acquisition of shares\n    by individuals. This should include understanding the tax\n    implications for employees/the company, whether any tax elections\n    are recommended and a review/preparation of any such elections.\n\n-   If employees do not pay the tax market value for their shares based\n    on tax valuation principles in the relevant territory, local tax\n    rules will dictate whether any undervalue would be subject to\n    payroll taxes or self assessment only.\n\n*Funding loans*\n\n-   For individuals receiving loans to fund the acquisition of their\n    equity, we recommend reviewing the expected tax implications for the\n    employee/company. Points to consider include benefit in kind tax\n    charges and appropriate interest rates to apply to the loan to\n    mitigate such charges, along with required recourse levels etc.\n\n-   In addition, where funding loans are provided, the corporate tax\n    implications of making the loans to employees/directors should be\n    considered. For example UK \"loan to participator\" anti-avoidance\n    rules which can create a temporary corporate tax charge (discussed\n    above).\n\n*Share repurchases/sales to others*\n\n-   Where shares are repurchased by the company consideration needs to\n    be given to the tax implications for the employee/the company. Key\n    considerations include whether shares are being repurchased for more\n    than market value, whether any payroll taxes are due and whether the\n    repurchase be a capital disposal or taxable as income."

This makes three CoA decisions on the unallowable purpose\nprovisions (CTA 2009 s441) in three months (following BlackRock and Kwik\nFit and in April). The latter two decisions were covered in our April\nand May editions respectively. When it rains, it pours?\n\nStepping back, HMRC succeeded in this case (as they have in the other\ntwo). The decision appears in line with the other recent cases in terms\nof approach to the unallowable purpose provisions. From a Private Equity\nperspective, it is worth highlighting that each of these cases concern a\nspecific set of facts (each from c.ten years ago). Specifically, this\none involves a 2011 transaction in which a US parented group had already\nagreed to acquire another US company, and (following tax adviser input)\nopted to structure the acquisition via a debt funded UK Acquisition Co\n(also using a Cayman FinCo). The intended effect was to have UK interest\ndeductions without taxable income in the US or the Cayman Islands.\n\nThe CoA decision from Lord Justice Newey is readable and clear. After a\nhelpful review of the facts\n\nand case law, he asks three questions, at \\[para 43\\]: i) Was there an\n\"unallowable purpose\"? ii) Was there a commercial purpose? iii)\nApportionment. In summary, the FTT found that there was an unallowable\npurpose, that there was no commercial purpose, and all the debits were\napportioned to the unallowable purpose. The CoA declined to interfere in\nany of those findings. In particular \\[para 71\\]; \\\"There are, of\ncourse, only limited circumstances in which an appellate Tribunal or\nCourt should interfere with either a finding of fact or an evaluative\nassessment\\\"."

The case,\n[[here]{.underline}](https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukut/tcc/2024/152),\nconcerned the treaty's \"main purpose\" exclusion embedded in the Interest\narticle. That denied the benefits of the treaty which said:\n\n> \\(5\\) The provisions of this Article shall not apply if it was the\n> main purpose or\n>\n> one of the main purposes of any person concerned with the creation or\n>\n> assignment of the debt-claim in respect of which the interest is paid\n> to take\n>\n> advantage of this Article by means of that creation or assignment.\n\nThe case revolved around debts owed by Lehman Brothers International\n(Europe) Ltd which was in administration. The debts had been acquired\nsecond hand by investors including a Cayman Islands company. A most\nunusual feature of the Lehmans administration is that creditors have\nbeen paid in full and with statutory interest. Whether such interest was\nyearly and thus attracted withholding tax was the subject of a separate\ncase. Accordingly the administrators settled the principal sums in\nSeptember 2016 but held back the interest pending a determination. The\nCourt of Appeal ruled in December 2017 in HMRCs favour."

    "chunk_text": "At this point, the Cayman holder who was entitled to some £91m of\ninterest decided to auction its claim in the expectation it would be\nacquired by an investor able, for whatever reason, to receive interest\ngross. It was sold for 91% percent of face value and was acquired by BLM\nin February 2018. The administrators paid the interest in July 2018 net\nof withholding tax (which was paid to HMRC). The Supreme Court confirmed\nWHT was due in March 2019. It is assumed that BLM did not have a treaty\nclearance in respect of this tranche of debt. Interestingly it already\nheld other Lehmans debt which was presumably paid gross.\n\nIndeed BLM is not some transient SPV but an entity that dates back to\n2009 and held some \\$7bn of assets before the debt purchase in question.\nIt continues to this day holding substantial assets.\n\nThe Upper Tier Tribunal approached the wording of the treaty in a\ndifferent way to the First Tier Tribunal.\n\n> 45\\. Unlike the FTT (reflecting the submissions of the parties) who\n> started with the ordinary meaning of the words used in Article 12(5)\n> of the UK-Ireland treaty, we start our analysis by considering the\n> object and purpose of the treaty having regard to the relevant OECD\n> and other materials.

However, it will enable us to put the\n> text in context.\n>\n> 46\\. In this connection, we are reminded of the comments of Lady Rose\n> in the Supreme Court..... where she deprecated the approach of\n> starting with dictionary definitions before considering the context\n> and purpose of the statutory scheme,\\...\\....\n\nAccordingly they concluded that unless there is an abusive arrangement\nBLM as an Irish resident and beneficial owner of the interest was\nentitled to treaty benefit. They then reject HMRCs proposition that the\nprovision applied because there was an abuse by the seller who had no\nidea if the successful bidder would avail of a treaty or be exempt for\nother reasons. The tribunal then grinds through HMRCs other grounds for\nappeal most of which build on the view that because there was an\narbitrage there was an advantage. The tribunal felt something more was\nneeded to show there had been an abuse.\n\nThe wording of the treaty is slightly different from that of the OECD\nMultilateral Instrument (\"MLI\") which tests \"obtaining that benefit\"\nrather than \"taking advantage of\". At the risk of starting with the\nordinary meaning of words, the MLI wording appears to cast a wider net.\n\nAnyway, an interesting aspect of the Lehmans payment is that it caused a\nsignificant spike in withholding tax payments. Dan Neidle of Tax Policy\nAssociates identified that the actual WHT receipts by HMRC are probably\nonly around £200m but some £800m was collected in respect of the Lehmans\ndebt. Though BLM should now have recovered some £18m of that. The point\nthough is that the UK is an outlier in Europe in charging withholding\ntax on interest. Is it worth the effort?"

Per our April edition, this is a *Ramsay* anti\navoidance/purposive interpretation case in which the CoA held that this\n\"ephemeral\" entity could not avail of an WHT exemption for UK tax\nresident companies (ITA 2007 s933) because it was not \"beneficially\nentitled\" to said interest. The decision is grounded in the statutory\nconstruction of the relevant provisions, and notes that \"beneficially\nentitled\" in this context is not \"immune from the requirement that\nlegislation be construed purposively\" \\[para 18\\].\n\nIs this case of \"wider interest\" than just for withholding tax on\ninterest? Well, \"beneficial entitlement\" and the separate but related\nconcept of \"beneficial ownership\" crop up elsewhere. The CoA decision\nreviews the case law of both concepts \\[paras 31-47\\], and notes that a\nnumber of principles can be derived from them \\[paras 48-54\\]. These are\nvery useful and concise summaries of a complicated area. The rationale\nfor this exploration follows in para 56 where they agree with the First\nTier Tribunal that the \"Indofood\" interpretation of beneficial\nentitlement is simply not relevant \"We are concerned with domestic tax\nlegislation and not an \"international fiscal meaning\".\n\n\"In essence, \\[beneficial ownership\\] means ownership for the benefit of\nthe person in question\" and the usual approach of statutory construction\nalways applies (e.g. taking into account the context of the provisions,\nnot just looking at words in isolation. I.e. here, s933 is a narrow\nexception to a general obligation to deduct in Part 17 ITA 2007, and\nthis is taken into account when construing its meaning). And thus, long\nstory short, simply transferring a receivable to a UK company to avail\nof 0% WHT was ineffective.\n\nAt this point it\\'s worth remembering that the UK's domestic exemption\ndoes not come with the \"Principal Purpose Test\" or advance treaty\nclearance requirements that protect cross-border payments. (See\nBurlington above - noting the fact pattern is quite different, e.g. in\nHargreaves, the UK tax resident company was \"ephemeral\" whereas as\nabove, the Burlington SPV had significant other assets etc)."

    "chunk_text": "**Pillar 2 - UK Governance guidelines for Engagement Leaders**\n\nPwC\\'s primary role for Pillar 2 (P2) related engagements over the next\n2-3 years will be to work with clients to determine the impact of the\nrules and help them comply with these very complex new rules. Our P2\nservices are wide ranging and could include advisory, compliance and\nreporting, technology projects and accounting services.\n\nThis document has been prepared to assist Engagement Leaders (ELs) in\nmanaging the risks associated with P2 and sets out the governance\nguidelines that ELs should adhere to in the course of engaging with\nclients. The key message here is that, in most circumstances, ELs should\nfollow our **normal ways of working and teams should feel empowered to\ndiscuss P2 with their clients** and to develop opportunities to support\nthem.\n\nHelping clients understand and comply with their P2 obligations is a\ncore part of our services which is very aligned with our purpose to\nbuild trust in society and solve important problems. As such we expect\nthere to be considerable activity helping clients adjust to the impact\nof P2. However, there are some heightened risks associated with P2 and\nin this note we want to help ELs identify the circumstances where they\nshould seek further support and governance because of those risks.\n\n**Enhanced risk profile**\n\nIn line with our existing Tax, Legal & People LoS governance approach,\nELs should consider whether any client engagements (new or in-flight)\nraise sufficient potential risks (including reputational, policy and/or\nprofessional standards concerns) to require a Tax LoS panel. If any risk\nfactors have been identified, ELs should consult their local Risk\ncontact, who will ensure that the correct governance procedures are\nfollowed, including setting up a Tax LoS Panel.\n\nWe note that P2 presents some unique and/or enhanced risks and that,\neven if our services are of a type that would normally seem low risk\n(e.g. compliance services), these factors may lead ELs to decide that a\nTax LoS Panel is required. Even if not required under our policies, ELs\nshould remember that a Tax LoS Panel can be a helpful forum to discuss\nthe risks and safeguards they are considering.\n\nExamples of such risks include:\n\n-   Whilst we are proposing to undertake compliance services, we become\n    > aware that the client is taking advice from other advisers to\n    > restructure their arrangements to give an improved P2 outcome.\n\n-   We might be asked to comment (potentially at short notice) on the UK\n    > elements of a transaction that is being managed overseas/by other\n    > advisers or internally; it is important we have sufficient scope\n    > and visibility of the wider transaction to be able to give\n    > informed advice and to assess and manage any risks"

    "chunk_text": "Pan-European funds investing into UK property Strictly private and confidential 12 December 2022\nPwC DraftBackground (page 1 of 3)\nStructuring considerations: investments into UK property\n•In recent years, there have been significant changes to the taxation of \nindirect and direct investments into UK property by non -UK tax \nresident investors. Specifically:\n-Measures introduced in the Finance Act 2019 extended the scope \nof the UK’s taxation of gains accruing to non -UK residents to \ninclude all gains on direct and certain indirect disposals of UK \nproperty, on or after 6 April 2019. Further changes to these \nprovisions were made by regulation in 2020 and 2021; \n-Prior to 6 April 2020 non -UK tax resident companies (such as a \nLux PropCo) were generally subject to UK income tax on UK \nproperty rental income (either through withholding or by direct \nassessment) unless the income was in relation to a UK permanent \nestablishment through which they were also carrying on a trade or \nan activity of trading in UK land. Since 6 April 2020, however, all \nnon-UK tax resident companies which carry on a UK property \nbusiness have been brought within the scope of UK corporation tax \nin respect of the profits of that business from that date. Under the \ncorporation tax regime additional restrictions arise in respect of the \ndeductibility of costs ( in particular interest costs) as a result of the \napplication of the corporate interest restriction rules and other \nprovisions, which have increased the effective tax rate; \n-The position is further exacerbated by the increase in the UK \ncorporation tax rate from 19% to 25% with effect from 1 April 2023;\n-Changes to the UK -Luxembourg double tax treaty likely to come \ninto effect from 1 April 2024, such that gains on disposal of UK \nproperty rich companies by Luxembourg resident entities will be \ntaxable in the UK.   •Consequently, the position of non -UK entities and funds holding UK \ninvestment property has become increasingly complex. As previously \ndiscussed with you, this means that there is no ‘one size fits all’ \nstructure for the holding of UK property by non -UK residents.\n•Indeed, there is now a heightened importance in considering the \nstatus of ultimate investors for UK tax purposes and selecting a \nstructure which would enable these investors to avail of any tax reliefs \nor exemptions afforded to them. This will need to be counterbalanced \nwith the operational costs and complexity, filing obligations and \nrestrictions relevant to each structure. \n•This paper seeks to consider the UK direct tax position relevant to the \nstructuring of UK property investments under [FUND] pan -European \nmanaged fund structures in relation to the following alternatives:"

This assumes [Luxembourg/other non -UK] \nproperty holding companies are used, but a UK company may \nalso be suitable.

Therefore, should remain possible to exit via tax free corporate sale and \nbenefit from SDLT saving.  A buyer may only apply a partial discount for any contingent gain on \nthe asset.\nCons\n•Partial discount may still be applied by buyer on contingent gain on share acquisition.

The UK property can be held directly or via other tax transparent vehicles such as partnerships or \nJPUTs.\n•Broadly a EUUT, which is subject to income tax at 20%, is entitled to a deduction for distributable amounts \nwhich can largely eliminate the tax payable on the trading activities. \n•In practice such a structure is likely to be difficult to implement for a pan -European fund as it requires only \neligible investors (investors who are exempt from UK tax on gains not by reason of residence) to invest via \nthe EUUT.\n•Specifically, the tax treatment set out above is switched off entirely and the EUUT effectively treated like a \nnormal corporate subject to corporation tax on all its profits if there is one non -eligible investor . \n•Therefore in the first instance the benefit is only obtainable for eligible investors and as such the relief will at \nbest be partial for a pan -European fund with a wide variety of investors."

The project should be of the benefit of the larger Danish companies and based on voluntary participation.   However, after more than 10 years the DTA has now converted TG from separate project to a cooperative audit approach. TG is part of the audit approaches applied by the DTA in addition to full tax audits, partial tax audits and spot checks of tax areas.

However, it should be noted that in Germany, there is the possibility to establish a Tax Compliance Management System (TCMS). The establishment of such a system is not mandatory. Nevertheless, a company that can demonstrate its adherence to an effective TCMS is more likely to successfully counter accusations of disorganisation within the company, thus reducing the risk of administrative penalties under Germany's Administrative Offence Act. Additionally, companies with a TCMS in place (and the ability to demonstrate adherence to it) will be better positioned in case the German tax authority's scrutiny focuses on negligence or tax evasion. | Not Applicable | Not Applicable | Not Applicable | As there is no TCF requirement, there are no rules on how to deal with TCFs in the context of an audit.  However, it cannot be ruled out that a TCF will have a positive impact on the audit. A TCF definitely helps when it comes to liability issues (e.g. to exclude intent or recklessness in the case of tax evasion). | Country-by-country reporting: Germany has also adopted the EU Directive which is applicable for annual reports published after 22 June 2024, effectively corporates following the calendar year 2025 will be the first year of reporting. Besides there is a draft law for the implementation of Pillar 2.  Best practice: Voluntary disclosures in accordance with GRI 207. Further WEF IBC (Total Tax Contribution) is only made by certain front runners in terms of tax transparency reporting. | German large corporate groups will be also affected by:  - Pillar 2 reporting  - Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) (to be applicable for the business years 2024 ongoing) - EU Taxonomy regime |"

The Indian tax authority collate information and perform reviews using technology to identify gaps in disclosures, and maturity/risk levels as well as to assist taxpayers in their compliances. These include: 1. With the increased adoption of digitalisation, all taxpayers need to file their tax return and indirect tax returns using their Permanent Account Numbers (PAN) and GST Number. Similarly, all Tax Deducted at Source/with-holding taxes are done with payer's PAN details. Additionally, all financial transactions such as dividend payments, interest, sale of securities are all linked to PAN/TAN (Tax Deduction Account Number). 2. Using the data compiled by tax authorities, taxpayers can access their TDS and income information instantly. This aids in ensuring comprehensive coverage of income sources for tax return filing. 3. Books of accounts must be maintained for specified years. 4. Based on the gathered data, tax authorities perform validation checks and algorithms to reconcile disclosures in tax filing (Corporate + Indirect Taxes). This assists in risk profiling taxpayers and identifying cases for in-depth audits or investigations. 5. The Directorate of Risk Assessment has established criteria for selecting audit cases. 6. Taxpayers are required to provide assurance in the tax audit report regarding (i) tax incentives and (ii) whether any (restructuring) transaction triggers GAAR (General Anti-Avoidance Rules) – which is yet to be notified. 7. The Government publishes (i) Effective Tax Rates for different classes of taxpayers and (ii) Industry-wise Revenue foregone due to tax incentives. This forms the foundation for the Government's future policy decisions and overall tax strategy. | Not Applicable | Not Applicable | Since there is no TCF requirement, there are no specific rules regarding TCFs in the context of audits.  Nevertheless, TCF is envisioned to aid tax authorities in understanding a company's approach to tax, risk management, and governance framework, including perspectives on potential tax liabilities. | Country-by-country reporting: All companies meeting the minimum threshold INR 6,400 crores (~EUR 750 mn) must file the CbCR with the tax authorities.   Furthermore, India, being a part of the G20, is likely to adopt the provisions of Pillar 2, with contextualization according to Indian regulations.

Normally, the submission of TCF evidence to Revenue before joining CCF is not required. However, the company must provide assurance to Revenue that an appropriate internal control framework exists for tax matters, encompassing all elements expected in a TCF. These framework details are discussed during the annual risk review meeting. It's strongly advised to have a well-developed TCF before joining CCF. Revenue has published criteria outlining TCF content, function, and suitability assessment in the context of CCF.  Additionally, the Companies Act 2014 introduced significant compliance reporting obligations for Directors through (\"Directors' Compliance Statements\"). It requires that an annual statement is included in the Directors' Report which is appended to the financial statements of a company. Directors are required to acknowledge their roles and responsibilities with regard to their compliance obligations as part of that statement and this includes tax compliance obligations. Directors must also confirm that they have put in place a compliance policy statement on their relevant obligations (including tax) and have put in place appropriate structures to ensure material compliance. If they have not done so, they must explain why not.   All public liability companies and large private companies are obliged to produce a statement (large private companies are defined as where the company's balance sheet > €12.5m and turnover > €25m). Unlimited companies are not affected. Directors are required to continuously monitor their compliance obligations and to ensure that any changes in tax obligations are satisfied. | There has been no indication of a compulsory introduction of a requirement for a TCF in Ireland. | The Revenue have set out what their requirements are in respect of a TCF as part of the CCF application process as follows:  A. The tax strategy should be clearly documented and should be owned by the senior management of the company/group  B. The tax strategy needs to apply comprehensively to all the company/group’s activities C. The roles and responsibilities of the company/group’s tax department to implement the tax strategy should be clearly set out and adequately resourced  D. Rules and reporting should be in place to ensure that transactions and events are compared with prior expectations and that potential risks of non-compliance are identified and managed appropriately. The governance process should be documented and its effectiveness reviewed periodically.  E. Compliance with the policies and processes of the tax strategy, its application and the governance of the process are regularly monitored, tested and maintained  F. The corporate governance, responsibilities, communications strategy and overall risk management strategies are capable of being communicated to Revenue to satisfy them that the company/group has the principles of a TCF in place.   When we produce a TCF for a client it would normally include the following key components: A. A TCF Manual which sets out the tax strategy of the company/group and sets out the overarching principles of the TCF  B. Operational Policy and Procedure documents for each tax risk area C. Detailed Tax Risk and Control Matrices setting out the controls and processes that are in place and any planned controls D. Evidence of testing performed on all these controls | Failure to include a Directors' Compliance Statement or to include a statement regarding why one was not included carries a maximum fine of €5,000 per Director and/or a maximum prison sentence of up to six months (on summary conviction).                                                           There is a risk that a company or group could be removed from the Revenue's Co-operative Compliance Framework where they are regarded by Revenue as not complying with the requirements of an adequate TCF.  We have not seen this occur in practice. | Within the Republic of Ireland, it is best practice to have a Tax control Framework in territory. | Many large corporate groups also have to comply with the following Tax transparency directives:  - EU public Country-by-Country Reporting - Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) 207 & World Economic Forum IBC (these are both a voluntary reporting standards which many groups are complying with) | We have outlines additional public reporting requirements which have been announced and will affect large corporate groups in the very near future:  - OECD Pillar 2 reporting (Due to be implemented by all impacted jurisdictions by December 2023) - Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) [Due to implemented from 2024 and first reporting period to be impacted is December 2024) - EU Taxonomy regime - International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) [Due to be implemented by all impacted jurisdictions by December 2024] |"

The new additions provide additional detail regarding what the Israel Tax Authority (ITA) expects to see in an Israeli TP documentation report. Additionally, the local taxpayer should have supporting documentation available, such as contracts and any disclosures made to foreign tax authorities, including requests for advance pricing agreements (APAs).  Master File: The updated Israeli TP rules introduce a Master File requirement for multinational groups. The Master File report includes comprehensive information about the group as a whole.

The master file is only required to be submitted by companies in multinational groups with a combined previous-year turnover exceeding NIS 150 million (approximately USD 43 million).   Country-by-Country Reporting (CbCR): The updated Israeli TP rules mandate that every Israeli parent company of a group with a previous-year group turnover exceeding NIS 3.4 billion file the CbC report (equivalent to EUR 750 million, as defined by the OECD and calculated using the 2015 exchange rate). The CbC report requirements in the updated Israeli TP Rules align with the OECD Guidelines. The CbC report will be automatically exchanged with other countries that have agreements with the State of Israel. In line with the OECD Guidelines, groups with Israeli parent companies can submit the CbC report through a surrogate company in another country with specific approval from the ITA. Regarding Pillar 2, the implementation legislation has not yet been drafted, and discussions within the ITA are ongoing on how to execute the implementation. When Pillar 2 is not yet applicable for Israeli tax purposes, it is expected to be implemented in Israel in the next few years. | Not Applicable |"

It was initiated by our Tax Authority, the Inland Revenue Board (IRB) and it is currently a voluntary programme, running from June 2022 to June 2024, covering direct taxes such as income taxes, withholding tax, transfer pricing and stamp duty, without any mandatory requirements as of now.  The TCGF programme is recommended for the following entities: i) Large companies/public listed companies with a turnover of RM100 million and above. ii) Companies that have won the Best Taxpayer Award. iii) Government-linked companies/State-owned enterprises. iv) Compliant taxpayers regarding return form submission and tax payment. v) Entities that: - Have medium to complex structures and business models. - Engage in voluminous transactions. - Place emphasis on Tax risk management as part of their corporate governance. - Rely on extensive in-built controls in their systems and processes, to generate timely and accurate data for financial and Tax reporting. - Cultivate transparency and openness in engaging with the IRB.   There are a number of benefits of joining the TCGF program which are detailed below: - Reduced scrutinisation of compliance activities, leading to fewer tax audits with higher materiality and reduced sample sizes. - Accelerated Tax refunds, subject to approval and no anomalies being noted. - Efficiency, with the appointment of a dedicated Tax officer to expedite any ongoing dialogue on tax technical matters. - Eligible for priority consideration concerning tax penalty rates and compliance activities step-down. | Not Applicable | The deliverables for the TCGF program are as follows: i) Interested entities must submit their participation form to the IRB. After reviewing the form and confirming suitability, the IRB will send a letter of invitation to participate in the TCGF program. Some companies fitting the criteria have also been directly approached by the IRB through an invitation letter.  ii) Upon IRB's approval, the entity must appoint an independent reviewer (approved tax agent, qualified internal auditor, or a qualified independent person) to assess their Tax Control Framework independently. iii) The entity then needs to submit their completed self-review assessment and the independent reviewer's report to the IRB within 6 months of participation approval. iv) Based on the submitted report and relevant documents, the IRB will conduct an assessment to determine whether the entity qualifies for the TCGF status, valid for 3 years. The entity must inform the IRB of their intention to renew participation within 12 months before the status expires. | Since this is a voluntary program, there are no penalties or sanctions in place. | Within Malaysia, it is best practice to have a Tax control Framework in territory. | i) Regarding the CbCR rules in Malaysia, they apply to Multinational entities with a consolidated group revenue of at least RM3 billion.

However, it becomes mandatory for companies entering the Dutch Tax and Customs Administration (DTCA) Cooperative Compliance program called \"(Advanced) Horizontal Monitoring\" [Dutch: (Doorontwikkeling) Horizontal Toezicht].   This program aims to increase mutual understanding, transparency, and trust between individual taxpayers and the DTCA. Participants in the program have one contact point with the DTCA and may benefit from pre-discussion on transactions or possible issues, earlier certainty on tax returns, and tailored supervision based on the quality of their Tax Control Framework. For the 'Top 100' largest for-profit companies, as classified by the DTCA, participation in this program is mandatory. It is voluntary for:  - The top 30 public sector and other large companies according to art. 2:397 Dutch Civil Code, meeting two of the following three criteria during two consecutive years: +€ 20 million assets, +250 employees, +€ 40 million revenue, when entering a horizontal monitoring agreement (covenant) - Other companies can participate through their tax service provider with a covenant with the DTCA. | There has been no indication of a compulsory introduction of a requirement for a TCF in the Netherlands. | Each Top 100 company is subjected to an individual supervision plan.  Entering into the individual covenant requires: 1. Willingness to be transparent; 2. Willingness to maintain an individual working relationship based on the core principles of Horizontal Monitoring; 3. Preparing a documented tax strategy; 4. Submitting a tax risk analysis, including an analysis of the key risks; 5. Having adequate monitoring with regard to key risks; 6. Guaranteeing the quality of the data required for the taxation of third parties.  During the individual covenant, the company must demonstrate: ▪ Working internal control and adequate monitoring of the most important tax risks. ▪ Transparency about its tax strategy and possible disruptions that could lead to errors in the tax return(s); ▪ Rapid, complete and unambiguous provision of requested information. | The DTCA's enforcement activities are trust-based. However, if taxpayers betray the trust placed in them, the DTCA may respond by increasing the stringency of its supervision and taking decisive action. | Within the Netherlands, it is best practice to have a Tax control Framework in territory.  Having a TCF and a Horizontal Monitoring covenant may lead to adjusted supervision from the DTCA, but legally they still have the right to conduct an audit if they wish to, although they may adjust the scope of their audit based on the work performed by the organisation. The organisation also still has the same chance to get selected at random in the yearly audit round-up. | Under DAC6, intermediaries have to report arrangements with an EU cross-border element falling within certain \"Hallmarks\" mentioned in the directive, and in certain instances where the main or expected benefit of the arrangement is a tax advantage.  Starting from 2024, Digital Platform Operators in scope of DAC7 are subject to: - Registration in a single member State, regardless of whether the Digital Platform Operator is located in the EU or in a third country. - Ongoing seller due diligence procedures to establish a.o. the tax residence of sellers and monitor for relevant changes in circumstances. - Annual reporting on sellers and their revenues generated on the digital platform to the competent authority in the EU member state where they are registered. | Financial institutions and pension funds are required by law to systematically identify and control integrity risks with respect to their own organisation, staff, products, services, and clients. Management includes tax integrity risk management and requires the organisation to develop and implement a tax policy, risk appetite statement, risk management including monitoring, and more. |"

Taxpayers can expect tax governance to be increasingly examined as a part of compliance reviews and audits. Evidence of tax governance in practice will also be important in negotiating penalties in cases where audit adjustments are imposed. | There has been no indication of compulsory requirements for a TCF in New Zealand. However, the Inland Revenue has communicated minimum expectations regarding the level of tax maturity that taxpayers are expected to operate at, which involves having established levels with robust processes in place, resulting in a high degree of capability and institionalised processes. To help taxpayers assess their current level of tax maturity and identify areas for further enhancement, IR has developed a 10-question framework. | The 10 question framework comprises of the following: 1. Does the company have a well-documented overarching tax strategy? 2. Does the CFO or Tax Manager confirm, as least once annually, that the tax strategy has been regularly reviewed, updated where necessary, and followed in practice? 3. Does the company have a tax control framework to manage day-to-day tax risks? 4. Has the operation of the tax control framework been independently tested in the last three years? 5. In the last three years, have any tax control deficiencies been identified, and if so, have any follow-up actions been taken to remediate those deficiencies? 6. Are key internal policies, procedures, and controls covering data collection, analysis, calculation, recording, and reporting for tax filing and other tax compliance requirements documented and available for examination if required? 7. Is there an annual review of changes to accounting policies that impact group financial statements and examination of items where tax treatment may differ materially from financial accounting treatment? 8. Is there a robust process for the finance and/or tax teams to stay updated on all relevant changes in tax law and related Inland Revenue guidance? 9. Is there a process in place to identify significant transactions that may require external advice and/or binding rulings and need to be reported to the board or relevant board sub-committees? 10. Does senior management regularly report to the board or relevant board subcommittees on potentially material tax issues or risks? | Evidence of tax governance in practice will assist in demonstrating that reasonable care has been taken in managing tax affairs, becoming increasingly important in the context of negotiating penalties when audit adjustments are imposed. | Within New Zealand, it is best practice to have a Tax control Framework in territory.  The earlier responses highlight the growing focus on tax governance as a part of local tax authority risk review and audit activity, and the importance of evidencing a taxpayer's tax control framework to demonstrate the level of reasonable care taken in managing tax affairs. | - CbCR: currently only applies to New Zealand headquartered MNEs. CbC reports can be exchanged by IR with tax authorities where an activated automatic exchange relationship exists.   - New Zealand’s Pillar Two legislation - while an enactment date has not been confirmed, these rules could start coming into effect from 1 January, 2024. | Not Applicable |"

In February 2022, IRAS introduced two other voluntary tax governance initiatives - Tax Governance Framework (TGF) and Tax Risk Management and Control Framework for Corporate Income Tax (CTRM). Companies may participate in any of these initiatives on a voluntary basis to demonstrate that it has a good tax governance and tax risk management. Over the past year, IRAS has sent out invitation letter to taxpayers encouraging them to participate in these programmes.  The TGF, CTRM and GST ACAP are voluntary compliance initiatives that operate independently, and a company may choose to adopt each or all of the initiatives depending on its readiness and business needs.  TGF features a set of broad principles and key practices that a company should incorporate in its tax governance policy for effective management of tax risks, covering both direct and indirect taxes. On the other hand, CTRM establishes robust internal controls and systematic risk management processes to identify, mitigate, and monitor key tax risks, along with ongoing review of the effectiveness of the internal controls and processes for managing tax risks.  Companies volunteering to join any of these initiatives receive benefits such as waiver of penalties for voluntary disclosure. | Not Applicable | TGF To participate in TGF, a company needs to make an application to IRAS by performing the following: (i) Publish the company's tax governance policy on the corporate website or an annual report that is publicly accessible. The tax governance policy should include details of how the company manages tax risks under the three building blocks of TGF. (ii) Complete the declaration form for TGF and have it signed by the CEO/CFO to confirm that the company adheres to the guiding principles and key practices outlined in TGF.  (iii) Submit the TGF application form via FormSG.  The application for TGF status is subject to IRAS' approval.  CTRM The company needs to ensure that it meets the prerequisites before participating in this program. Companies will have to submit their participation form to IRAS after performing a self-evaluation of the CTRM checklist, ensuring they meet at least 60%. IRAS will review the participation form before confirming the company's eligibility to participate in the CTRM programme.    i) Upon IRAS' approval of the company's participation, the company will proceed to complete and collate a list of information for the qualified independent reviewer appointed by the company to commence the CTRM Review, which may include tests of controls or substantive testing, and document the procedures used, evidence obtained, and findings, gaps, and lapses etc. ii) The CTRM Reviewer will prepare the reports prescribed by IRAS. iii) The company will submit a list of prescribed CTRM related documents to IRAS for evaluation. iv) IRAS will then conduct an assessment based on the report and relevant documents submitted.   Upon the assessment, IRAS will determine if the company should be awarded the CTRM status, which will be valid for a period of 3 years.  The company is encouraged to commence the CTRM renewal process 6 months before the expiry of the CTRM status award. | No, these programmes are not mandatory at this juncture. | Within Singapore, it is best practice to have a Tax control Framework in territory.  Adopting the framework helps companies attain and maintain good standards of tax governance and raises tax governance to attention at the Board level. | CbCR - Singapore-headquartered MNEs meeting certain thresholds must prepare and file CbC Reports to IRAS for FYs beginning on or after 1 Jan 2017.  Pillar 2 - In Budget 2023, it has been announced that Singapore plans to implement the GloBE rules and DTT for businesses’ financial year starting on or after 1 January 2025. More details will be shared by the Government in due course. | Not Applicable |"

As part of a tax audit, the Spanish tax authorities may request information about the tax criteria adopted by the audited entity, but it is not mandatory to have a Tax Control Framework. However, publicly traded companies in Spain are required to have a public tax policy. Furthermore, although not mandatory, Spain has a Code of Good Tax Practices that establishes ethical principles for the relationship between the tax administration and companies. It doesn't provide specific benefits to adhering companies, but it promotes transparency and collaboration. Adhering to the code can streamline tax management and enhance the company's reputation in terms of tax compliance. It signifies a commitment to operate ethically and fulfil tax obligations responsibly. This can strengthen the relationship with the tax administration and the perception of the company in the tax domain. | Not applicable. | Publicly traded companies are required to disclose their tax policy in their annual accounts. This entails providing details on how they manage their tax affairs, including aspects such as tax planning strategies, compliance with tax obligations, tax risks, and any other relevant elements related to tax management. | In Spain, the failure to comply with the obligation to report on the tax policy in the annual accounts of publicly traded companies may be subject to administrative penalties as established by the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV), the regulatory body for the securities market in Spain. | Spain use their own unique approach- (Except for the reporting obligations in publicly traded companies). The Spanish tax administration, to initiate tax audits, uses its own checks and detection tools.

As a guideline, the Code of Conduct for tax authorities, taxpayers, and tax advisors in Switzerland by Expert Suisse, could be considered, setting out principles for good behaviour of tax authorities, taxpayers, and tax advisors with respect to each other.  Furthermore, there is an increased trend for companies to publish quantitative and qualitative tax data that is not required by accounting or other legislative standards, such as other than corporate income taxes paid and/or taxes collected, as well as increased narrative such as tax strategy, tax governance framework, tax risk and control framework, etc.   In this regard, many companies refer to the recommendations of sustainability standards like GRI and various rating agencies like DJSI, MSCI, etc. | Any publication is voluntary.

Applies to UK incorporated companies that meet one or both of the following criteria ('large businesses'), either alone or when aggregated with other UK companies in the same group: - Annual turnover of more than £200 million, and/or - Relevant balance sheet total of more than £2 billion (i.e. gross assets before deducting liabilities) | Not Applicable | Local Tax authority (HMRC) uses a Business Risk Review regime to evaluate tax risk for large business taxpayers across three behavioural categories:  (1) Approach to tax compliance  (2) Internal governance (3) Systems and delivery  The overall risk rating awarded sets the tone for the frequency and type of interaction with HMRC going forward. Key governance documentation expected by HMRC is as follows:  UK Tax Strategy -  Large Businesses need to annually publish online their strategy as it relates to UK Taxation setting out the following:  (a) the company's approach to risk management and governance arrangements in relation to UK taxation (b) the company's attitude towards tax planning (so far as affecting UK taxation) (c) the level of risk in relation to UK taxation that the company is prepared to accept (d) the company's approach towards its dealings with HMRC  SAO - Documented Risk and Control Matrices (RACMs); tax strategy/policy; tax risk management policy etc as well as testing of relevant tax controls would form part of good practice in demonstrating compliance with the SAO regime and may help to show that reasonable care has been taken by an entity despite an error occurring.  CCO - Documented risk assessment setting out the key risks and mitigating controls in place to prevent criminal facilitation of tax evasion by parties providing services for or on behalf of the group. This is intrinsically linked to existing financial crime legislation and there is draft legislation before Parliament to review whether the rules should be expanded to include fraud. | Tax Strategy - Penalties may be levied if: your business met the requirements to publish a tax strategy but failed to publish one, your business published a tax strategy that did not include all relevant information and your business does not ensure the tax strategy is made available for free for the appropriate period.  Potential penalties include: a £7,500 penalty for not publishing a compliant tax strategy, a second £7,500 penalty if the compliant tax strategy has not been published six months after it should have been, another £7,500 penalty for each following month until the compliant tax strategy is published.  HMRC should issue a non-statutory warning notice to publish a compliant tax strategy within 30 days, during which if a compliant document is published, a penalty will not be levied.  SAO - Failure to notify HMRC of the identity of the SAO may result in a £5,000 penalty payable by the company. The SAO could personally be liable to a separate £5,000 penalty for failure to provide a certificate, or providing an incorrect certificate. A further £5,000 personal penalty is also applicable if the SAO fails to take reasonable steps to ensure that the company establishes and maintains appropriate tax accounting arrangements. Failure to do so could also result in higher tax geared penalties for failure to take care.  CCO - A successful prosecution could lead to an unlimited penalty, a corporate criminal conviction, a public record of the conviction (and reputational damage) and severe regulatory impacts. | Within the UK, it is best practice to have a Tax control Framework in territory.  The risk rating awarded to groups post Business Risk Review sets the tone for the frequency and type of HMRC interactions. These often drive the nature of audits/enquiries initiated by HMRC.  As a reminder, we have outlined the potential risk ratings below and what this practically means from a HMRC action standpoint:  - Low: Can expect no interventions from HMRC for 3 years following the receipt of this risk rating - Moderate low/Moderate High: Can expect further inventions from HMRC on specific tax process which require further scrutiny until resolved - High: Potential additional Business Risk Review meetings to take place annually until the risk rating of the group has been reduced included detailed interventions in specific tax processes | Many large corporate groups (see defined within column E33) also have to abide by the following Tax transparency directives:  - UK Requirement to publish a Tax Strategy (See column F) - EU public Country-by-Country Reporting - Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) 207 & World Economic Forum IBC (these are both a voluntary reporting standards which many groups are complying with) | We have outlines additional public reporting requirements which have been announced and will affect large corporate groups in the very near future:  - OECD Pillar 2 reporting (Due to be implemented by all impacted jurisdictions by December 2023) - Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) [Due to implemented from 2024 and first reporting period to be impacted is December 2024) - EU Taxonomy regime - International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) [Due to be implemented by all impacted jurisdictions by December 2024] |"
