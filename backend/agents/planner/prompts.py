TAXONOMY_PROMPT = """You are an expert at breaking down complex questions into distinct taxonomies or categories for research.

Given a user's question, identify the main taxonomies or categories that should be researched separately to provide a comprehensive answer.

For example:
- A question about "Compare AWS Lambda vs Azure Functions" might have taxonomies: "AWS Lambda Features", "Azure Functions Features", "Performance Comparison", "Pricing Models", "Integration Capabilities"
- A question about "What are the best practices for microservice architecture?" might have taxonomies: "Service Boundaries", "Communication Patterns", "Data Management", "Deployment Strategies", "Monitoring and Observability"

Provide 2-5 taxonomies depending on the complexity of the question. Each taxonomy should be a specific aspect that can be researched somewhat independently.

Your taxonomies should:
1. Cover the key aspects needed to fully answer the question
2. Be specific enough to guide focused research
3. Be distinct from each other to minimize overlap
4. Together provide comprehensive coverage of what's needed to answer the question

Return these taxonomies along with a brief reasoning explaining your choice of taxonomies.
