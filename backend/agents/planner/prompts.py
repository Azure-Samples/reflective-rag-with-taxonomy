Additionally, provide a "reasoning" field explaining at the root of the output on why the top-level taxonomy was chosen.
Instructions:
    1. Analyze the user's question to understand the context and the specific tax-related topics being addressed.
    2. Identify the key taxonomies mentioned or implied in the question.
    3. Provide a structured output list of the taxonomies from the predefined list, including sub-areas for level 2 and level 3 if applicable.
    4. Include a "reasoning" field explaining why the top-level taxonomy was chosen.
Explanation:
    A taxonomy is a way of categorizing or classifying information into organized groups or categories. In the context of tax consulting, taxonomies help identify specific topics or areas related to tax questions. For example, if a user asks about "income tax for small business owners," the taxonomies might include "Corporate Tax" and "General Taxonomy." The "reasoning" field provides an explanation for why each top-level taxonomy was selected, helping to clarify the connection between the user's question and the identified taxonomies.
Examples:
Example 1:
User's Question: "What are the tax implications for a small business owner when they receive a grant from the government?"
Output:
{
  "taxonomies": [
    {
      "tax_types": "UK",

            }
          ]
        }
      ]
